# LifeOS Data Classification & Inference-Source Routing

> The doctrine that decides **which inference source may process which data**. Four data classes, four+ inference sources, one per-route routing matrix. Fail-closed. Designed + adversarially hardened 2026-06-18; routing policy revised by the principal the same day.

## Why this exists

LifeOS draws inference from sources at different trust/egress tiers. Native (Anthropic) and Forge (OpenAI) are the two trusted US vendors; the GLM route (GLM via the OpenRouter broker, `OpenRouter.ts`) is an additional external cloud. Each external call is a data-egress surface. This doctrine classifies every piece of data and binds each class to the routes allowed to see it.

**The core principle: data egress is ranked by trust, content is ranked by sensitivity, and a route may only process data at or below its ceiling. Unclassified data is RESTRICTED (fail-closed).**

## The four data classes

| Class | Rank | One-line test | Leak consequence |
|-------|------|---------------|------------------|
| **RESTRICTED** | 0 (highest) | "If this showed up in someone else's logs, do I have to rotate something or notify someone?" | Irreversible — rotation, breach notice, contract/law break |
| **CONFIDENTIAL** | 1 | "Is this about MY health, money, security posture, private strategy, or inner life?" | Real harm (embarrassment, competitive loss, profiling) — no rotation |
| **INTERNAL** | 2 | "Would I shrug if a trusted peer saw this, but I haven't published it?" | Low — reveals how the system works, not who I am |
| **PUBLIC** | 3 (lowest) | "Is this already on the internet, or built to go there?" | None — already public or publish-destined |

**RESTRICTED** — auth material, third-party PII, customer-owned data. `.env` + anything quoting it; API keys/OAuth/Cloudflare/Google creds; customer-owned engagement data; contacts' PII; financial source docs. Paths: `**/.env`, `LIFEOS/USER/CONFIG/CREDENTIALS/**`, `LIFEOS/USER/WORK/CUSTOMERS/**`, `LIFEOS/USER/TELOS/FINANCES/**`, `LIFEOS/USER/CONTACTS.md`. **Also the fail-closed default.**

**CONFIDENTIAL** — {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}'s own sensitive life/business data: health, financials, own-infra security findings, TELOS internals, hot-layer + relationship memory, People/Companies notes. **Default for all of `LIFEOS/USER/**`** except RESTRICTED sub-globs and named PUBLIC demotes.

**INTERNAL** — private but not sensitive: ISAs, work notes, plans, non-PII knowledge, non-secret config, system internals. Paths: `LIFEOS/MEMORY/**`, `skills/**`, `LIFEOS/USER/CONFIG/**` (minus CREDENTIALS), `CLAUDE.md`, `LIFEOS/LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.

**PUBLIC** — already published or publish-destined: live blog/newsletter content, the **scrubbed `sync-docs.ts` output only** (raw `LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/**` is INTERNAL until scrubbed), post-SecurityFilter daemon profile, `CANONICAL_CONTENT.md`, public repo source.

## The inference sources

| Tier | Source | Vendor | Egress |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 | **LOCAL** | on-device (ollama) | none — **NOT YET WIRED** |
| 1 | **NATIVE** | Anthropic | home vendor, subscription/enterprise terms |
| 2 | **FORGE** | OpenAI (codex) | external, single known vendor |
| 2 | **GENE** | OpenRouter broker → GLM 5.2 | external **broker** — non-deterministic downstream provider/country; most opaque |

## The routing matrix (the rule)

**The ceiling is per-ROUTE — source + model + data-residency — not per-source** (principal policy, revised 2026-06-18). Three rules, most-restrictive wins:

1. **RESTRICTED-capable vendors — Anthropic (Native) + OpenAI (Forge) ONLY.** These two trusted US vendors may process every class, including RESTRICTED. No other provider or model ever touches RESTRICTED.
2. **Chinese-origin model → INTERNAL ceiling.** Any model from a Chinese lab (GLM/Z.ai, Kimi/Moonshot, MiniMax, Qwen, DeepSeek) caps at INTERNAL regardless of who hosts it — and only when routing is guaranteed off China/Russia; an opaque broker with no such guarantee drops to PUBLIC.
3. **US/allied model, US inference, US company, verified no China/Russia egress → up to CONFIDENTIAL.** Otherwise PUBLIC.

LOCAL (on-device) handles everything. **A route's ceiling depends on the model AND the residency:** the GLM route pinned to a US+ZDR provider reaches INTERNAL; the same route unpinned drops to PUBLIC.

Resolved ceilings for the wired routes:

| Route | Ceiling | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| NATIVE (Anthropic) | RESTRICTED | trusted US vendor |
| FORGE (OpenAI) | RESTRICTED | trusted US vendor |
| GENE · GLM 5.2, pinned US + ZDR (default: Fireworks) | INTERNAL | Chinese model, residency guaranteed by allowlisted US provider |
| GENE · GLM 5.2, unpinned **or** non-US pin | PUBLIC | residency not guaranteed (could route to CN/RU) |

Machine-readable form: `maxClassForRoute()` / `ROUTES` in `LIFEOS/TOOLS/models.ts`. Live enforcement: `hooks/EgressClassGuard.hook.ts`.

**Note on Forge/OpenAI at RESTRICTED:** assumes OpenAI's enterprise / zero-retention API terms apply to the codex path. Worth explicit confirmation — a principal-risk decision, not an inherited default.

## Marking convention

Path-default-first, fail-closed, mark-only-the-exceptions:

1. **Path defaults** via `LIFEOS/USER/CONFIG/data-classification.json` (longest-match wins). *"If you didn't tag it, it's as locked as its directory."*
2. **Demote-only tags** — public-facing files inside a stricter tree carry `data_class: PUBLIC` frontmatter (DAEMON.md, CANONICAL_CONTENT.md). Tag *down* only.
3. **Auto-promote by content** — a secret-shape match anywhere → RESTRICTED, blocked from all cloud sources.
4. **In-flight requests** declare class; inline `[[dc:public]]` for one-offs.
5. **Precedence**: auto-promote > explicit tag > path default; conflicts resolve to the more restrictive.
6. **Mixed payloads inherit the highest class** of any constituent.

## Enforcement

**Built + LIVE:**
- `hooks/EgressClassGuard.hook.ts` + `hooks/lib/egress-class-core.ts` — PreToolUse Bash gate, registered in the Bash matcher. Detects `bun … OpenRouter.ts` execs, classifies the payload (secret-shape scan + sensitive-path references), and BLOCKS anything above the route ceiling. Gates at Bash, so it catches both direct calls and any subagent's own internal OpenRouter.ts calls. Fail-closed on a confirmed Tier-2 route; never blocks unrelated Bash. Logs to `LIFEOS/MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/egress-decisions.jsonl`. No LLM in the path. Verified by an 8-case battery + an observed live block.
- `LIFEOS/TOOLS/models.ts` — `SOURCE_TIER`, `RESTRICTED_CAPABLE_VENDORS`, `CHINESE_MODEL_PATTERNS`, `maxClassForRoute()`/`isRouteAllowed()`, `ROUTES`.
- `LIFEOS/USER/CONFIG/data-classification.json` — path-default glob table.
- The hard guard is the deterministic `EgressClassGuard` hook (above); `OpenRouter.ts` forces `provider.data_collection: deny`. (The former `Gene.md` agent's soft prompt-guard was retired with the persona 2026-07-02; the capability now lives entirely in the tool + hook.)
- **GLM route INTERNAL-by-default (2026-06-20):** the GLM/OpenRouter route now default-pins a US+ZDR provider (Fireworks) so its standing ceiling is INTERNAL, not PUBLIC. `egress-class-core.ts` grants the INTERNAL ceiling ONLY when the `--pin` value is on the `US_ZDR_PROVIDERS` allowlist; an unpinned call or a non-US pin fails closed to PUBLIC. The pin is honored as a *constraint*, not a preference: `OpenRouter.ts` sends `provider.order:[pin]` + `allow_fallbacks:false`, so if the pinned US provider is down the call **errors** rather than silently rerouting off-US (verified live: a Fireworks rate-limit returned 429, did not fall back). Two honest caveats this doctrine must not blur: (1) **ZDR ≠ residency** — `data_collection:deny` is a retention/training guarantee; US *geography* comes only from the pinned provider being US infra (OpenRouter's metadata claim), they are orthogonal. (2) **The broker is inside the trust boundary** — OpenRouter proxies plaintext and has its own logging policy, so the INTERNAL leak surface = OpenRouter infra + the pinned provider, not the provider alone. Acceptable for INTERNAL; named here rather than hidden. The gate enforces residency (route geography); the INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL *content* line still rests on the shape-scan + operator discipline (the gate sees secret-shapes and USER-paths, not semantic CONFIDENTIAL prose) — closing the prior "GLM wrapper pin" gap on residency, not on semantic content classification.

**Still planned:**
- Path/identity scrub for INTERNAL→Tier-2 (reuse sync-docs.ts + Daemon SecurityFilter rules).
- Pulse statusline count; ShadowRelease release-time backstop.

**Known limits of the v1 gate (honest):** it inspects the Bash *command string* — so it catches secrets and sensitive *paths named in the command*, but NOT the file *contents* the tool reads at runtime, nor free-prose PII with no token-shape or path reference. Strong first layer, not complete.

## Gaps / roadmap

1. **LOCAL (ollama) not wired** — RESTRICTED data has no on-device model destination; today it's redact-or-deterministic-code only.
2. **`data-classification.json` needs review** before deeper wiring.
3. **No INTERNAL→PUBLIC downgrade-for-egress token** yet.
4. **`LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/` is dual-state** — raw=INTERNAL, scrubbed=PUBLIC; pin the scrub-output dir into the PUBLIC glob.
5. **Secret-shape scan catches tokens, not prose PII.**
6. **Return-path leakage uncontrolled** — governs input, not what a response echoes out.
7. **Non-inference egress** (raw WebFetch/WebSearch, skill curls, Telegram/Discord/email) is out of scope here.
