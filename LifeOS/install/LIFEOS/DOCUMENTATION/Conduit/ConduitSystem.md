# Conduit — LifeOS's Sensory Layer

> **Conduit is the "current-state" pole of the current→ideal loop.** LifeOS has always
> known your ideal state (TELOS) but not your actual state — what you do day to day. So
> it could not answer "are we working on the right stuff?" Conduit gives LifeOS eyes: a
> local, continuous, opt-in capture layer that records where attention actually goes,
> rolls it into a daily record, and feeds that record to the memory and TELOS systems.
> Design ISA: `LIFEOS/MEMORY/WORK/20260704-conduit-context-gathering/ISA.md`.

**Component version:** Conduit v1.0.0 · shipped in LifeOS 6.1.0.

## Design principles

- **A mirror you pull, not a watcher that pushes.** Conduit hands you your own attention
  back; it never volunteers a verdict and never produces a single alignment "score"
  (that would just invite gaming — Meadows LP3). Distribution + record, you judge.
- **Perception feeds the existing loop.** Conduit is one new input that makes memory
  curation, WorkSweep, TELOS state, and Pulse smarter — not a second dashboard.
- **Highest signal tier per source; watch the account, not the window.** Where a source
  has an API (Gmail, Calendar, GitHub), read the account, not the app's pixels.
- **Stable by construction.** v1 is deterministic — no model, no cloud, no long-lived
  daemon. Stateless launchd polls, fault-isolated adapters, a pure rollup.
- **Privacy is absolute.** All data under `USER/`, on this machine, never leaves it.

## Where things live (the hard boundary)

| Kind | Location |
|------|----------|
| **Code** (system area) | `LIFEOS/PULSE/Conduit/` + Pulse module `LIFEOS/PULSE/modules/conduit.ts` |
| **Data** (USER) | `LIFEOS/USER/CONDUIT/` — `config.json`, `state.json`, `events/<date>.jsonl`, `daily/<date>.{md,json}`, `logs/` |

Only code lives in the code area; every byte Conduit captures lives under `USER/`.

## Architecture

launchd (com.lifeos.conduit, every 120s)
      │  conduit capture
      ▼
┌─────────────── adapters (fault-isolated) ───────────────┐
│ appFocus (osascript front app)                          │
│ git (new commits across configured repos)               │
│ claudeSession (reads MEMORY/STATE/work-events.jsonl)    │

   (/api/conduit) (daily context) (observed vs ideal) (untracked work)
```

### Event schema

One JSONL line per captured signal. Spans + metadata only — never keystrokes or content.

```ts
interface ConduitEvent {
  ts: string;                    // ISO-8601 UTC
  type: "app-focus" | "git-commit" | "claude-session";
  source: string;                // adapter id
  app?: string; repo?: string;   // dimension keys
  detail?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Deterministic rollup

`buildDailyRecord` is pure (input events → record, no side effects, no model). Each
app-focus event contributes one poll interval to its app's time; a sleep gap never
inflates time because launchd fires no polls while asleep. The classifier (`classify.ts`)
splits apps into creation / consumption / neutral by a static, editable map — the honest
v1 proxy for challenge C1. `narrative` and `telosTags` are reserved seams, null/empty in v1.

## Integration with TELOS (current → ideal)

- **Join key = TELOS IDs.** The v2 scoring layer tags each block with a goal/dimension/
  challenge ID; that tag is the foreign key between observed and ideal.
- **Read side:** the daily rollup reads live TELOS as its rubric — no cached goal copy,
  so a TELOS change is picked up on the next rollup (no drift).
- **Write side:** Conduit writes the daily record; `UpdateLifeosState.ts` gains an
  observed-time signal alongside the self-reported one.
- **Invariant:** TELOS owns ideal state, Conduit owns observed state; **neither writes
  the other's file.** They meet only at the gap computation (`LIFEOS_STATE`/`ComputeGap`).
  Conduit may never edit a goal.
- **Update mechanism:** reuse `DerivedSync.ts` + launchd — the daily-record write triggers
  the LIFEOS_STATE recompute. Three clocks: continuous capture, daily rollup, event-driven
  derived refresh.

## CLI

```
bun LIFEOS/PULSE/Conduit/conduit.ts <command>
  capture         run enabled adapters once, append events, lazy-roll the prior day
  rollup [date]   build + persist the daily record (default: today)
  today           print today's live distribution (not persisted)
  status          config + today's event count
  init            write default config under USER
  version         print Conduit version
```

## Install (launchd)

```
bun LIFEOS/PULSE/Conduit/InstallConduit.ts             # install + load (polls every 120s)
bun LIFEOS/PULSE/Conduit/InstallConduit.ts --status    # launchd state
bun LIFEOS/PULSE/Conduit/InstallConduit.ts --uninstall # unload + remove
```

## Pulse surfaces (data/code separated)

1. **Dashboard tab** (`/conduit`) — the primary surface, a Next.js client component at
   `Observability/src/app/conduit/page.tsx` (static-exported to `out/`, served by `pulse.ts`).
   It holds **ZERO data**: it fetches everything live from `/api/conduit/*` and renders. Three
   panels answer the three questions the sensory layer exists to answer — **what's flowing in**
   (the hourly content-type read), **sources & cadence** (per-source status), and the deterministic
   time/creation view — plus an honest empty-state when no read exists yet.
2. **JSON API** (`PULSE/modules/conduit.ts`, loaded in `pulse.ts` `loadModules()`; read-only over `USER/CONDUIT`):
   - `GET /api/conduit/today` — today's live deterministic record
   - `GET /api/conduit/recent?days=N` — last N daily records
   - `GET /api/conduit/sources` — **per-source status**: id, label, one-line "what it captures",
     enabled, `pollIntervalSec`, `eventsToday`, `lastEventTs`. Deterministic — from config + events, no model.
   - `GET /api/conduit/insight` — the latest **content-type read** (falls back to the most recent
     day when today's is absent, `stale: true`; a failed/empty read serves `available: false`).
   - `GET /api/conduit/status` — module health.

All hold zero data in code — they render/serve the contents of USER data.

## Content-type read (the hourly cheap-inference layer)

The "what kind of stuff is coming in?" question is the one genuinely non-deterministic part, so it —
and only it — uses a model. `Conduit/BuildInsight.ts` runs **hourly** under launchd
(`com.lifeos.conduit.insight`, `InstallConduitInsight.ts`), reads the day's events, builds a
**metadata-only, bounded** summary (top-15 apps + counts, git subjects, session slugs — never content),
and calls `LIFEOS/TOOLS/Inference.ts --level low` (haiku rung, **subscription billing** — Inference
scrubs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`). It writes `USER/CONDUIT/insights/<date>.json`
(`narrative` + weighted `contentTypes[]`). **Cheap & sustainable by construction:** cheapest rung, one
call per hour, **idempotent** — a `since` watermark skips the call entirely on an idle hour, and a
failed read never clobbers a good one. The tab reads the cached file; it never calls a model on load.

> launchd gives jobs a minimal PATH that lacks `claude`, so the installer bakes the installer's PATH
> into the plist (`EnvironmentVariables`) — otherwise the scheduled job `spawn ENOENT`s and falls back
> forever. This is macOS-only; a Linux install needs a cron equivalent for the hourly schedule.

## Configuration (`USER/CONDUIT/config.json`)

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "pollIntervalSec": 120,
  "sources": { "appFocus": true, "git": true, "claudeSession": true },
  "repos": [],
  "retentionDays": 30
}
```

Per-source opt-in is first-class. `repos` is the list of absolute paths watched for
commits. Raw event logs older than `retentionDays` are pruned after rollup; daily
records are kept.

## Privacy contract

- Local-only; all data under `USER/CONDUIT/`; nothing leaves the machine.
- Per-source opt-in; disable any source in config.
- Tiered retention: raw discarded after `retentionDays`; daily record kept.
- Kill switch: `enabled: false`, or `InstallConduit.ts --uninstall`.
- No screenshots, no window titles, no message content in v1.

## Versioning

`CONDUIT_VERSION` (`version.ts`) tracks the component; bump on any change to the event
schema, adapter contract, or rollup format. Conduit v1.0.0 ships in LifeOS 6.1.0.

## Roadmap

- **v1 (shipped):** deterministic capture (appFocus + git + claudeSession) → daily record; launchd; Pulse module; retention.
- **v1.1 (shipped 2026-07-05):** intuitive tab — sources & cadence panel (`/api/conduit/sources`), the hourly cheap-inference **content-type read** (`BuildInsight.ts` → `insights/<date>.json` → `/api/conduit/insight`), honest empty/stale states. Subscription inference, `--level low`, idempotent skip-on-idle. This is the pragmatic realization of the `narrative` seam via subscription inference (vs the Ollama-class local model originally sketched for v2).
- **v2 — TELOS scoring:** activity→TELOS-goal tagging, filling the `telosTags` seam. **Gated by the D-11 validation spike** (can a cheap model reliably tag a synthetic day against TELOS?).
- **v3 — reach adapters:** wire `_INBOX` / `_CALENDAR` as tier-1 account readers.
- **v1.5 — browser adapter:** Dia/Chrome extension → active URL (makes in-browser C1 visible).
- **later:** iMessage metadata; optional screenshot/vision fallback.
