# Memory System

> In Life OS terms (`LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/LifeOs/LifeOsThesis.md`), memory is how the OS knows your **current state**. The hill-climb is only as good as the system's picture of where you actually are — what you're working on, what failed, who you know, what you learned. Every capture pipeline below exists to sharpen that picture so the gap to ideal state is measured against reality, not guesses.

**LifeOS's file-system-based memory. Everything we know, everything we've learned, everything we've researched, everything we're working on.**

This is not a narrow event log or a preferences store. This is LifeOS's comprehensive knowledge system — the full shared memory between the principal and the DA. If we built knowledge together, it belongs here. That includes: work tracking, learnings from failures and successes, research and OSINT investigations, contact dossiers, security events, runtime state, voice events, observability metrics, and any other knowledge that would be valuable in future conversations.

**One storage layer:**
- **LifeOS MEMORY** (`~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/`) — structured, hook-driven, entity-based

LifeOS MEMORY is the system of record. Claude Code's built-in auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`) is disabled by design (`autoMemoryEnabled: false` in shipped settings, plus deny rules on that path) — see "Claude Code Auto-Memory & Auto-Dream" below.

**Version:** 8.2.0 (Proposal Subtypes + Session Rename CLI, 2026-05-25; preserves 8.1 inventory + drift + autonomic loop + health gate)
**Location:** `~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/`

---

## Architecture

**Claude Code's `projects/` is the source of truth for transcripts. Hooks capture domain-specific events directly. Harvesting tools extract learnings from session transcripts. Auto-memory captures everything else — research, OSINT, contact profiles, reference material.**

Retrieval & Navigation (on-demand):

```

**Key insight:** Hooks write directly to specialized directories. There is no intermediate "firehose" layer — Claude Code's `projects/` serves that purpose natively. Retrieval tools read the same markdown files without any intermediate index or database.

## Typed-Item Memory System (Autonomic Loop)

The autonomic mutation loop sits on top of the existing Memory subsystem inventory below. Architectural concepts (turn-cadence reviewer, cap-as-prompt, set-overwrite writes, debounced cancellable scheduler) reimplemented natively in TypeScript/Bun. Zero runtime dependency on third-party agent frameworks.

**Health gate & per-turn indicator (2026-05-24 addendum):**

- `LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryHealthCheck.ts` — 22-check CLI. Verifies hook files on disk, hooks registered in BOTH `settings.system.json` AND `settings.json` (catches the regression class where edits to the derived file silently revert at SessionStart), state file readable, last reviewer fire within 7 days, at least one historical reviewer run captured, both `_MEMORY.md` files present. Exit 0/1/2 = ok/warn/critical. Writes per-invocation row to `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/memory-health.jsonl`.
- `hooks/MemoryHealthGate.hook.ts` — Stop-chain hook running the check on every turn end. WARN/CRITICAL surfaces to stderr. Non-blocking.
- `<pai-memory-delta>` additionalContext block — `MemoryDeltaSurface.hook.ts` (invoked at UserPromptSubmit by `MemoryTurnStart.hook.ts`) emits it **change-only** as one verbatim `🧠 MEMORY` line, and adds `<pai-memory-health>` when the latest `memory-health.jsonl` row is CRITICAL. (`MemoryReviewTrigger`'s every-UserPromptSubmit `<autonomic-memory>` frozen banner — which carried `turns_since_last_review`, `pending_review`, `last_review_*`, `cadence`, etc. — was retired/merged 2026-07-11; see Superseded.)
- Render contract in `LIFEOS/LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` (v3.0.0, one-format): the DA renders the hook-fed `🧠 MEMORY:` line verbatim when a `<pai-memory-delta>` block is present that turn, omits it otherwise — change-only; the model never computes the line. (The seven-state every-turn render table retired with the NATIVE mode template, 2026-07-11.)
- Source-of-truth wiring: the memory hooks (`MemoryTurnStart`, `MemoryReviewFire`, `MemoryHealthGate`) live in `settings.system.json` so `LIFEOS/TOOLS/MergeSettings.ts` regeneration at SessionStart preserves them.

### Thirty-second story

> {{DA_NAME}} has one memory system. Every item in it has a type — memory, idea, knowledge, or proposal. A background reviewer reads recent conversation and emits typed items. The system routes each item to the right place based on type. Memory items load into every prompt. Ideas and knowledge load when relevant. Proposals get surfaced in Telegram for yes/no/edit. Four safety tiers gate writes by destination. That's it.

### Type registry

Defined in `LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryTypes.ts`. Frozen at module load — adding a type requires source edit + commit, not runtime mutation.

| Type | Storage | Load timing | Tier | Write mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `memory` | `USER/PRINCIPAL/PRINCIPAL_MEMORY.md` (actor=daniel), `USER/DIGITAL_ASSISTANT/DA_MEMORY.md` (actor=kai) | always (hot-layer, every prompt) | A | set-overwrite, cap 48 × 256 chars |
| `idea` | `MEMORY/IDEAS/<slug>.md` | on relevance (BM25) | B | append (atomic rename) + tier-b-writes.jsonl audit |
| `knowledge` | `MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/{People,Companies,Research}/<slug>.md` | on relevance (BM25) | B | append + tier-b-writes.jsonl audit, with `related:` cross-link merge |
| `proposal` | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/pending-proposals.jsonl` | Telegram surface only | C (gates the eventual write) | queue (status: pending → sent → accepted/rejected/edited/auto-applied) |

**Type is data, tier is permission.** Type tells the routing layer WHERE an item belongs. Tier tells the writer WHETHER the write is allowed. They're orthogonal — never collapsed.

### Proposal subtypes (P1 2026-05-25)

Proposals carry a `target_kind` discriminator that tells the reviewer which curated-context file class the proposal targets. The reviewer's prompt teaches the model when to emit each subtype; the dispatcher validates `(target_kind, target_file)` against the closed allowlist in `PROPOSAL_KIND_TO_FILES` (`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryTypes.ts`); the Telegram surfacer renders the subtype as a `[kind]` badge in the proposal header. `target_kind` is optional for backwards compat — when absent, the dispatcher infers it from `target_file`.

| `target_kind` | Target file | Trigger for emission |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` | `USER/PRINCIPAL/PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md` or `USER/DIGITAL_ASSISTANT/DA_IDENTITY.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} reveals a durable identity-level fact about himself or about how he wants {{DA_NAME}} to operate |
| `style` | `USER/PRINCIPAL/WRITINGSTYLE.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} corrects voice/tone/cadence in a way that generalizes — banned vocabulary, preferred constructions |
| `definition` | `USER/DEFINITIONS.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} defines a term (coined concept, principle's exact meaning, acronym) future {{DA_NAME}} must interpret correctly |
| `canonical-content` | `USER/CANONICAL_CONTENT.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} names a piece of content (post, talk, framework) as canonical to his body of work |
| `resume` | `USER/PRINCIPAL/RESUME.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} mentions a career fact (new role, certification, achievement) that should land in the resume |
| `operational-rule` | `USER/CONFIG/OPERATIONAL_RULES.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} states an operating directive about HOW {{DA_NAME}}/LifeOS should handle a class of work |
| `projects` | `USER/PROJECTS.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} names a new project that should be in the project routing table |
| `contacts` | `USER/CONTACTS.md` | {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} mentions a person 3+ times with role, relationship, and why they matter |

Confidence guidance:
- **≥ 0.70** — auto-apply silently to the target file (the queue row transitions `pending → auto-applied` and the reviewer's `dispatchItems` calls `applyProposalEdit`)
- **0.40–0.69** — Telegram surfacing with `[kind]` badge for principal `yes/no/edit #id` reply
- **< 0.40** — discouraged unless cross-session pattern is clear

### Curation coverage at a glance

The reviewer + four-tier classifier covers a defined slice of `~/.claude/` content. The canonical coverage matrix (which files the system curates, which it ignores, which other autonomic pipelines own) lives in [`CurationCoverage.md`](./CurationCoverage.md).

### Four mutation tiers

Defined in `LIFEOS/TOOLS/MutationTier.ts` — code-only allowlist, default-deny on everything not enumerated:

| Tier | Behavior | Paths |
|---|---|---|
| A | Auto, full set-overwrite | `PRINCIPAL_MEMORY.md`, `DA_MEMORY.md` |
| B | Logged-append (tier-b-writes.jsonl audit row per write) | `PROJECTS.md`, `CONTACTS.md`, `MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/**`, `MEMORY/IDEAS/**` |
| C | Propose-only (queue + Telegram approval) | `PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md`, `DA_IDENTITY.md`, `WRITINGSTYLE.md`, `DEFINITIONS.md`, `CANONICAL_CONTENT.md`, `RESUME.md` |
| D | Untouchable by the memory system | everything else (`.env`, `settings.json`, `hooks/`, code, `CLAUDE.md`, `LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, `Algorithm/`, `skills/`, …) |

### Components

- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryTypes.ts`** — type registry. Resolvers for storage path per item.
- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryWriter.ts`** — set-overwrite primitive for Tier A memory files. Atomic rename, lock sidecar, prefix soft-convention, dedupe, cap enforcement.
- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemorySystem.ts`** — the single public API. `add(item)` routes by type; `find(query, options)` returns BM25 top-K.
- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryRetriever.ts`** — BM25 retriever over the typed-item corpus including the two hot-layer memory files. Pure-function, no LLM call, ~30ms over 500+ notes.
- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryReviewer.ts`** — the autonomic centerpiece. Single-pass orchestrator: locate most-recent harness transcript, extract last N exchanges, call `Inference.ts` (Sonnet, env-scrubbed subscription billing, `--tools ""`), parse `{items:[...]}` JSON, route each typed item through `MemorySystem.add()`.
- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MutationTier.ts`** — tier classifier. Pure function, no config file (code-only allowlist).
- **`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryStatus.ts`** — read-only `kai status` viewer for terminal use.
- **`hooks/MemoryReviewFire.hook.ts`** — Stop handler, v2 (2026-07-11: tick + decide + fire in one pass; absorbed the MemoryReviewTrigger cadence gate). Increments turn count, sets `pending_review=true` when cadence gates fire.
- **`LIFEOS/PULSE/modules/telegram.ts`** — adds `## PRINCIPAL MEMORY` and `## DA MEMORY` blocks to the per-turn LifeOS CONTEXT injection (mtime-cached 60s); intercepts `yes #id` / `no #id` / `edit #id <text>` / `proposals` replies for proposal handling; piggy-backs one pending proposal onto the next reply.

### Reviewer cadence

State at `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/review-state.json`. Trigger conditions are AND-gated; defaults in `USER/CONFIG/memory-review.json`:

- `turn_count >= 8` AND
- `minutes_since_last_review >= 30` AND
- `idle_minutes >= 2`

When all three hold, the next Stop hook spawns the reviewer subprocess. New UserPromptSubmit before Stop cancels (debounce — Honcho's dream-scheduler pattern, vendored).

### Per-turn retrieval

`buildLifeosContextBlock(query)` in `LIFEOS/PULSE/modules/telegram.ts` calls `getRelevantContext(query)` (in `MemoryRetriever.ts`); the BM25 top-K (default 5, score threshold 0.20) renders as a `## RELEVANT MEMORY` block injected after the hot-layer memory files and before `PRINCIPAL_TELOS`. Below-threshold returns empty (no header noise). Cache TTL 60s by query-hash. Graph traversal (`KnowledgeGraph.ts`) stays available as a separate explicit call — not on the hot path.

### Observability

| Stream | Path | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Memory-file writes | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/memory-writes.jsonl` | MemoryWriter |
| Reviewer runs | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/reviewer-runs.jsonl` | MemoryReviewer |
| Reviewer-fire events | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/reviewer-fires.jsonl` | MemoryReviewFire hook |
| Tier-B append audit | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/tier-b-writes.jsonl` | MemorySystem.add |
| Proposal lifecycle | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/identity-proposals.jsonl` | telegram.ts surfacer |
| Proposal replies | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/proposal-replies.jsonl` | telegram.ts reply handler |
| Per-turn retrievals | `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/memory-retrievals.jsonl` | MemoryRetriever |

### Reading status

```
bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryStatus.ts          # human-formatted block
bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryStatus.ts --json   # machine-readable
```

Reports hot-layer file utilization, corpus sizes, pending-proposals depth, reviewer state, last reviewer run, last retrieval.

## Curation + Visibility + Recoverability (2026-06-06, Hermes/Honcho parity — CANONICAL)

Source ISA: `LIFEOS/MEMORY/WORK/20260605-203000_memory-alive-hermes-curation/ISA.md`. This supersedes the prior 2026-05-28 `<autonomic-memory>` banner and the every-turn heartbeat-enforcement approach (both are gone — see *Superseded* below).

The autonomic loop now genuinely **adjusts** and is **visible**, fixing the two defects that made the prior build look complete while it was silently frozen.

### Curation, not appending (the forgetting model)

The reviewer runs in **curation mode**: it reads the file's CURRENT entries (`readCurrentMemorySnapshot`) plus recent conversation and returns the **full desired next state** via a `memory` item with `op: "set"` + `entries[]`. `MemorySystem.add` routes `op:"set"` to `MemoryWriter.setEntries` as a REPLACE — so **forgetting is omission**: a stale fact is dropped by leaving it out, a contradicted fact is superseded (drop old + write new). This is the Honcho peer-card model ("replaces the entire card — does not merge"), chosen over Hermes substring verbs because full-set replace is atomic and unfragile. The reviewer prompt enforces: supersede contradictions, merge duplicates, **consolidate before adding when ≥80% full (≥39/48)**, write **declarative facts not directives** (Hermes verbatim), and an expanded do-not-save list (task progress, SHAs, PR numbers, anything stale in 7 days). Legacy `op:"add"` merge-append is retained for back-compat. This permanently kills the `EAT_CAP` cap-jam: the system can always drop to make room.

### Data-loss guard (in-lock)

set-overwrite has a whole-file blast radius. `MemoryWriter.setEntries` computes a **catastrophic-shrink guard IN-LOCK** (against the just-read prior state, race-free): it blocks a result that is near-empty (`< 3` entries) OR a mass deletion (`>50%` dropped) **with zero additions**, while ALLOWING honest large consolidation (many drops accompanied by additions). `ESUSPECT_SHRINK` is the error; `allowDrastic` opts out for legitimate restores. (This guard exists because a cross-vendor audit wiped the live file with an empty `op:"set"` — it's now structurally impossible.)

### Per-write snapshots (recoverability)

Every Tier-A write calls `snapshotBeforeWrite` — the prior file content is copied to a ring buffer at `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/memory-snapshots/<file>__<ts>.md` (last 30 per file) before the overwrite. So any individual autonomic write is reversible — not just at git-commit granularity. Recover via `bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryRestore.ts {list | restore <snap> | latest <principal|da>}`.

### Always-on visibility (`🧠 MEMORY` + `🩺 health`)

`hooks/MemoryDeltaSurface.hook.ts` (UserPromptSubmit, synchronous — stdout must inject) is the visible heartbeat — **deterministic and always-on** as of 2026-06-11 (principal-directed Hermes-style redesign). Every primary-session prompt gets a `<pai-memory-delta>` block with one of two line forms, rendered **verbatim** (hook-computed, never model-computed — the every-turn *self-policed* line remains the failure to never repeat):

- **Delta form** (rows newer than the monotonic cursor where `updated_by === "MemorySystem.add"`, smoke/manual/restore skipped): `🧠 MEMORY: +N learned · −M dropped — "<samples>" · <grade> (<n>/<t> fresh)`. Samples are truncated and pass an instruction-shape filter (`[withheld — instruction-shaped]`) because memory items can originate from external content and verbatim echo into context is an injection channel.
- **Heartbeat form** (no new rows): `🧠 MEMORY: <grade> (<n>/<t> fresh) · due: <stalest> · last curation … ago` — freshness from `USER/CACHE/freshness.json` with a 24h staleness guard (`⚠ freshness data Nd ago`, never confident stale numbers; missing/corrupt cache degrades to `no data`/`unreadable`, exit 0).
- It also reads the latest `memory-health.jsonl` row; when CRITICAL it injects `<pai-memory-health>` → a `🩺 MEMORY HEALTH:` line that nags every turn until fixed. This is the "silent failure is impossible to ignore" guarantee — the cap-jam sat unread in that log for two weeks.

**Liveness guards (2026-06-11, after the 5-day dead surface):** the hook's registration was clobbered by a concurrent-session whole-file `settings.json` rewrite (`787f66ef7`) and change-only silence hid it. Now: the hook touches `MEMORY/STATE/delta-surface-heartbeat` every run; `MemoryHealthCheck` lists it in `REQUIRED_HOOKS` (both settings files) and goes CRITICAL via `delta-surface-dead` when memory writes run >24h past the heartbeat. This bounds detection to ≤24h for guarded hooks — the settings writer itself is still last-writer-wins (class fix outstanding).

`OutputFormatGate.hook.ts` (retired/merged 2026-07-11) kept the heartbeat check at `log` (observability only) — it never blocked on the line, because absence can be legitimate (subagents, hook errors) and blocking was the 2026-05-28 failure mode.

### Health detection

`MemoryHealthCheck.ts` (run on Stop by `MemoryHealthGate.hook.ts`) now also detects the silent-failure class: **cap-pressure** (`≥44/48` → warn) and **reviewer failures** (recent runs with `ok:false`/`parse_ok:false` → warn; any `EAT_CAP` drop in a dispatch → CRITICAL, the real data-loss signal).

### Superseded

The 2026-05-28 `<autonomic-memory>` frozen banner (emitted by `MemoryReviewTrigger`, retired/merged 2026-07-11) and the every-turn `OutputFormatGate` (retired/merged 2026-07-11) heartbeat *enforcement* are gone. The banner was model-noise; the enforcement made an every-turn line mandatory and failed compliance repeatedly. Both replaced by the change-only hook-fed surfaces above plus the deterministic `🧠 MEM` statusline.

### 3. Inline "what just landed" narration

When `dispatched_since_last_turn > 0` and the latest reviewer run dispatched at least one item, the banner's line 2 surfaces a verbatim excerpt of the most recent item:

- `memory` type → last entry of `PRINCIPAL_MEMORY.md` or `DA_MEMORY.md` (whichever was written), truncated to 80 chars.
- `knowledge` / `idea` types → file slug (without `.md`).
- `proposal` type → target file path.

`LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` § 🧠 MEMORY indicator's ACTIVE-state row extended: when the banner shows a `└── +N just landed` line, the heartbeat line in `📃 CONTENT` (NATIVE) or SUMMARY CONTENT (ALGORITHM) must append the verbatim suffix (truncated to 60 chars).

### 4. `kai insights [--days N]` CLI

`LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryInsights.ts` — pure deterministic delta reader over `MEMORY/OBSERVABILITY/*.jsonl`. Default window `--days 1`. Sections: window, memory growth (per file), knowledge / idea adds, proposals by status (with 3 recent samples), reviewer runs (success rate, p50 / p95 latency), health snapshot, freshness verdict.

```
$ bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/MemoryInsights.ts --days 1

`fresh` / `fresh-with-misses` / `stale` / `cold` / `degraded` / `unhealthy` are the canonical verdict values.

## Directory Inventory (authoritative)

This is the canonical list of every directory under `~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/`. The `MemoryDirIntegrity.ts` drift handler (called by `DocIntegrity.hook.ts` on Stop) parses this table and warns whenever the on-disk tree contains a directory not listed here, or this table lists a directory that no longer exists. Add new memory subsystems by adding a row to this table FIRST, then creating the directory.

**Class definitions:**
- **core** — top-level LifeOS subsystem; written by core hooks/pipelines; documented in this file.
- **skill-private** — `_X`-prefixed directory owned by an individual skill named `_X`. Content schema is the skill's responsibility, not the core memory system. Listed here so the drift hook recognizes them; full documentation lives in the owning skill's SKILL.md.
- **reserved** — directory exists in the taxonomy and ships with public releases (via `ShadowRelease.ts` FLAT_README_ROOTS) but is not currently written by any core component. Either stays reserved or gets removed in a future migration.

**Adding a memory subsystem:** Add a row above, create the directory with a one-page README, and (if it has structured frequency) add a writer reference to the Hook Integration table below. The drift hook will accept the new directory on next Stop.

---

## Skill-Private Memory (the `_X` Convention)

Skills that need to persist their own state may create a directory under `MEMORY/` whose name is the skill's name with an underscore prefix. Examples: the `_NETWORK` skill writes to `MEMORY/_NETWORK/`, the `_AIRGRADIENT` skill writes to `MEMORY/_AIRGRADIENT/`, the `_HELIOS` skill writes to `MEMORY/_HELIOS/`.

These directories are listed in the Directory Inventory so the drift hook recognizes them, but their internal structure is owned by the skill that writes them. Documentation for what lives inside lives in the skill's SKILL.md, not here.

**Why the convention:** the underscore prefix sorts these to the top of `ls` output and visually separates skill-owned data from core LifeOS subsystems. It also mirrors the `_*` convention already used for `KNOWLEDGE/_archive/`, `KNOWLEDGE/_embeddings/`, `KNOWLEDGE/_harvest-queue/`, and `KNOWLEDGE/_index.md`/`_schema.md` — anything underscore-prefixed is metadata, queue, or scope-private.

## Directory Details

### Claude Code projects/ — Native Session Storage

**Location:** `~/.claude/projects/-Users-{username}--claude/`
*(Replace `{username}` with your system username, e.g., `-Users-john--claude`)*
**What populates it:** Claude Code automatically (every conversation)
**Content:** Complete session transcripts in JSONL format
**Format:** `{uuid}.jsonl` — one file per session
**Retention:** 30 days (Claude Code manages cleanup)
**Purpose:** Source of truth for all session data; harvesting tools read from here

This is the actual "firehose" — every message, tool call, and response. LifeOS leverages this native storage rather than duplicating it.

### KNOWLEDGE/ — Organized Knowledge Archive

**What populates it:** Algorithm LEARN phase (direct writes on the kb-v3 envelope), manual `/knowledge add`, `MemorySystem.renderInitialNote` (autonomic reviewer writes), KnowledgeHarvester.ts (validates against schema, reflections disabled)
**Content:** Curated knowledge notes organized by object type — people, companies, ideas, blogs, research. Topic is a tag, not a domain.
**Format:** Markdown files with a single flat, typed **kb-v3 frontmatter envelope** — `id`, `type`, `title`, `tags`, `status`, `quality`, `source_name`/`source_url`/`source_author`/`source_date`/`source_kind`/`source_session`, `created`/`updated`, typed `related`, `convention: kb-v3`. The contract lives in `LIFEOS/TOOLS/KnowledgeSchema.ts` (single source of truth); `_schema.md` is GENERATED from it via `GenerateKnowledgeSchemaDoc.ts`.
**Purpose:** Browsable, organized, AND queryable archive of entities we'd look up by name — harvested from sessions and manual captures

**5 object types:** People, Companies, Ideas, **Blogs** (archived external posts — ~85% of the corpus), Research. `type: X` on disk; topic is a tag. (Bookmarks are `status: inbox` + `source_kind: bookmark`, not a 6th type.)
**The lookup test:** "Would {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} look this up by name?" — if yes, it's knowledge. If not, it belongs in WORK/ or LEARNING/.
**Research vs. Ideas:** If it involved multiple sources, parallel investigation, verification, and produced a comprehensive dataset — it's research. A single insight or thesis is an idea. Research entries link to full output in WORK/.
**What doesn't belong:** Task logs, algorithm reflections, ISA checklists, verification stubs → WORK/ and LEARNING/, not KNOWLEDGE/
**Note types:** reference, synthesis, moc, source, temporal
**Status lifecycle:** seedling → budding → evergreen (90-day expiry for unreferenced seedlings → `_archive/`)
**Linking:** `[[kebab-case-wikilinks]]` for explicit links, tags for cross-cutting, `rg` for backlinks, semantic embeddings deferred
**Navigation:** `_index.md` MOC dashboards per entity type (auto-generated, structured: recently-updated, most-referenced, by-tag, seedlings)

**Key principle:** Algorithm LEARN phase writes directly with proper schemas (best context to capture what was learned). Harvester validates against schema and handles maintenance. Topic (security, AI, business) is a tag on the entity, not a separate domain.

**kb-v3 schema toolchain (2026-07-05):** the archive migrated from three competing frontmatter dialects (v2.0 / pai-memory-v1 / an undocumented blog-import dialect) onto ONE enforced contract. The toolchain lives in `LIFEOS/TOOLS/`:
- **`KnowledgeSchema.ts`** — pure-data source of truth (Core Envelope + per-type required fields + relation vocab) + body-safe parse/normalize/validate. Deliberately separate from the memory-WRITE registry in `MemoryTypes.ts` (that's `memory|idea|knowledge|proposal`; this is the archive object-schema `person|company|idea|blog|research`).
- **`KnowledgeLint.ts`** — conformance validator, splitting envelope-conformance (~100%) from per-type source completeness. Karpathy's "Lint," made real.
- **`MigrateKnowledge.ts`** — the idempotent, body-byte-preserving migration that brought all ~4,400 notes onto kb-v3 (dry-run default; deterministic ids; reversible via git in the user-data repo).
- **`KnowledgeQuery.ts`** (`kb query`) — filter/sort on type, tag, source-name/author/date/kind, status, created-range, quality, title, typed relations; table/json/count/slugs. The queryability payoff, and the archive is now Obsidian-Bases-queryable for free.
- **`GenerateKnowledgeSchemaDoc.ts`** — regenerates `_schema.md` FROM the schema so the human doc can't drift from the code.
- **`MemorySystem.renderInitialNote`** now emits the kb-v3 envelope (was pai-memory-v1), so new autonomic notes are born conformant. Design + rationale lives in the session's work-directory ISA.

### WORK/ — Primary Work Tracking

**What populates it:**
- Algorithm (AI) creates work dir with ISA.md during execution
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` on Stop (updates ISA/THREAD)
- `SessionCleanup.hook.ts` on SessionEnd (marks COMPLETED)

**Content:** Flat work directories with a single ISA.md as source of truth
**Format:** `WORK/{timestamp}_{slug}/ISA.md` — consolidated metadata + ISC + decisions + changelog
**Purpose:** Track all discrete work units with lineage, verification, and feedback

**ISA.md Structure (v4.0 — consolidated single file):**
- **YAML frontmatter** — session metadata (id, title, session_id, status, effort_level, completed_at, iteration count, verification_summary)
- **STATUS** — progress table (criteria passing, phase, next action, blockers)
- **APPETITE** — time budget, circuit breaker, ISC target count
- **CONTEXT** — problem space from user prompt, key files
- **RISKS & RABBIT HOLES** — populated during THINK phase
- **PLAN** — populated during PLAN phase
- **IDEAL STATE CRITERIA** — checkbox markdown (`- [x]`/`- [ ]`) as system of record
- **DECISIONS** — non-obvious technical decisions logged during BUILD/EXECUTE
- **CHANGELOG** — timestamped entries replacing THREAD.md

**Work Directory Lifecycle:**
1. Algorithm execution → AI creates work dir with ISA.md (frontmatter includes session metadata)
2. `PostToolUse` → ISASync syncs ISA frontmatter to work.json on Write/Edit
3. `SessionEnd` → SessionCleanup marks ISA status COMPLETED, clears state

**Note:** Legacy work directories (pre-2026-02-22) may have META.yaml, ISC.json, THREAD.md alongside ISA.md. All consumers check ISA.md frontmatter first, fall back to legacy files.

### LEARNING/ — Categorized Learnings

**What populates it:**
- `SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts` (explicit ratings + implicit sentiment + low-rating learnings)
- `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` (significant work session completions)
- `SessionHarvester.ts` (periodic extraction from projects/ transcripts)
- `LearningPatternSynthesis.ts` (aggregates ratings into pattern reports)

**Structure:**
- `LEARNING/SYSTEM/YYYY-MM/` — LIFEOS/tooling learnings (infrastructure issues)
- `LEARNING/ALGORITHM/YYYY-MM/` — Task execution learnings (approach errors)
- `LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/YYYY-MM/` — Aggregated pattern analysis (weekly/monthly reports)
- `LEARNING/REFLECTIONS/algorithm-reflections.jsonl` — Algorithm performance reflections (Q1/Q2/Q3 from LEARN phase)
- `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` — All user satisfaction ratings

**Categorization logic:**
| Directory | When Used | Example Triggers |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| `SYSTEM/` | Tooling/infrastructure failures | hook crash, config error, deploy failure |
| `ALGORITHM/` | Task execution issues | wrong approach, over-engineered, missed the point |
| `FAILURES/` | Full context for low ratings (1-3) | severe frustration, repeated errors |
| `REFLECTIONS/` | Algorithm performance analysis | per-session 3-question reflection from LEARN phase |
| `SYNTHESIS/` | Pattern aggregation | weekly analysis, recurring issues |

### LEARNING/FAILURES/ — Full Context Failure Analysis

**What populates it:**
- `SatisfactionCapture.hook.ts` via `FailureCapture.ts` (for ratings 1-3)
- Manual migration via `bun FailureCapture.ts --migrate`

**Content:** Complete context dumps for low-sentiment events
**Format:** `FAILURES/YYYY-MM/{timestamp}_{8-word-description}/`
**Purpose:** Enable retroactive learning system analysis by preserving full context

**Each failure directory contains:**
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Human-readable analysis with metadata, root cause notes |
| `transcript.jsonl` | Full raw conversation up to the failure point |
| `sentiment.json` | Sentiment analysis output (rating, confidence, detailed analysis) |
| `tool-calls.json` | Extracted tool calls with inputs and outputs |

**Directory naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_eight-word-description-from-inference`
- Timestamp in PST
- 8-word description generated by fast inference to capture failure essence

**Rating thresholds:**
| Rating | Capture Level |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 2 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 3 | Full failure capture + learning file |
| 4-5 | Learning file only (if warranted) |
| 6-10 | No capture (positive/neutral) |

**Why this exists:** When significant frustration occurs (1-3), a brief summary isn't enough. Full context enables:
1. Root cause identification — what sequence led to the failure?
2. Pattern detection — do similar failures share characteristics?
3. Systemic improvement — what changes would prevent this class of failure?

### WISDOM/ — Compounding Domain Knowledge (Level 3)

**What populates it:** Algorithm LEARN phase writes Frames; `WisdomFrameUpdater.ts` updates them with new observations; `WisdomCrossFrameSynthesizer.ts` extracts cross-domain principles.
**Content:** Domain-specific Frames (living models of communication, development, deployment, etc.), cross-frame Principles, and META frame-health metrics.
**Format:** Markdown frames per domain (`FRAMES/{domain}.md`), markdown principles (`PRINCIPLES/verified.md`), JSON/markdown health reports (`META/`).
**Purpose:** Anticipation, taste, contextual judgment, transfer — the layer above LEARNING/ patterns. While LEARNING/ captures events (Level 1) and patterns (Level 2), WISDOM/ captures Frames — living, contextual, evolving models of each domain.

**Structure:**
- `FRAMES/` — Domain-specific wisdom models (communication.md, development.md, deployment.md, etc.)
- `PRINCIPLES/` — Cross-domain principles confirmed across 3+ frames (`verified.md`)
- `META/` — Frame health metrics and system status

**Dual-loop integration:** Algorithm OBSERVE reads Frames → work happens → Algorithm LEARN writes Frames. Knowledge compounds across sessions.

**Tools:**
- `WisdomDomainClassifier.ts` — Route requests to relevant frames
- `WisdomFrameUpdater.ts` — Update frames with new observations
- `WisdomCrossFrameSynthesizer.ts` — Extract shared principles and generate health reports

### RESEARCH/ — Investigations & Agent Outputs

**What populates it:** Agent tasks write directly; OSINT workflows; any multi-agent research
**Content:** Agent completion outputs, OSINT dossiers, investigation reports, competitive analysis, deep dives
**Format:** `RESEARCH/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS_AGENT-type_description.md`
**Purpose:** Archive of all research and investigation work — the structured output side of knowledge we build together

**Note:** Research findings should ALSO be summarized as auto-memory entries (reference type in `projects/<project>/memory/`) so they're discoverable at session start. RESEARCH/ holds the full output; auto-memory holds the summary and pointer.

### SECURITY/ — Security Events (Active — v3.0)

**What populates it:** `SecurityPipeline.hook.ts` on tool validation
**Content:** Security audit events (blocks, confirmations, alerts)
**Format:** `SECURITY/security-events.jsonl`
**Purpose:** Security decision audit trail

### STATE/ — Fast Runtime Data

**What populates it:** Various tools and hooks
**Content:** High-frequency read/write JSON files for runtime state
**Key Property:** Ephemeral — can be rebuilt from RAW or other sources. Optimized for speed, not permanence.

**Key contents:**
- `algorithms/` — Per-session algorithm state files (`{sessionId}.json` — phase, criteria, effort level, active flag)
- `kitty-sessions/` — Per-session Kitty terminal env (`{sessionId}.json` — listenOn, windowId for tab control and voice gating)
- `tab-titles/` — Per-window tab state (`{windowId}.json` — title, color, phase for daemon recovery)
- `session-names.json` — Auto-generated session names from SessionAutoName hook
- `work.json` — Canonical session registry. Keyed by slug; each entry holds `sessionUUID`, `phase`, `progress`, `criteria[]`, `phaseHistory[]`, `lastToolActivity`, etc. Written by `ISASync.hook.ts` on every ISA edit and by `PromptProcessing.hook.ts` for native rows. Read by `/api/algorithm`, `/api/life/work`, `ULWorkSync`, `SessionCleanup`, `WorkCompletionLearning`. The pre-v6.9 `current-work.json` pointer is gone — `work.json` is the single source of truth.
- `progress/` — Multi-session project tracking
- `integrity/` — System health check results

This is mutable state that changes during execution — not historical records. If deleted, system recovers gracefully.

**`events.jsonl` — Unified Event Log:**

An append-only JSONL file where hooks emit structured, typed events alongside their normal state writes. Each line is a JSON object with `timestamp`, `session_id`, `source`, `type`, and type-specific fields. The type field uses a dot-separated topic hierarchy (e.g., `algorithm.phase`, `work.created`, `rating.captured`, `voice.sent`). This file is an observability layer — it does NOT replace any of the mutable state files listed above. Events are written by `${LIFEOS_DIR}/hooks/lib/observability-transport.ts` using synchronous append, and errors are silently swallowed so the event log never disrupts hook execution. Consumers can tail or `fs.watch` this file for real-time visibility into LifeOS activity.

### OBSERVABILITY/ — Structured Telemetry

**What populates it:** Many hooks and tools write `*.jsonl` files here for the Observability pipeline.
**Content:** Tool activity, tool failures, config changes, teammate events, anthropic call sites, anthropic costs, gap history, session costs, vendor costs, statement spend, UniFi syslog, speedtest, home-sensor, perimeter.
**Format:** Append-only JSONL, one file per source (e.g. `tool-failures.jsonl`, `anthropic-cost.jsonl`, `config-changes.jsonl`).
**Purpose:** Single canonical home for structured telemetry consumed by Pulse Observability dashboards.

**Writers (non-exhaustive):**
- `hooks/EventLogger.hook.ts` → `tool-activity.jsonl`, `tool-failures.jsonl`, `config-changes.jsonl` (consolidated 2026-07-11)
- (No rotation: OBSERVABILITY/ and SECURITY/ JSONLs are NOT auto-rotated today — rotation is queued with the sensor-loop iteration. The former log-rotation lib in hooks/lib was dead code with zero importers and was removed 2026-06-12.)
- `LIFEOS/TOOLS/CostTracker.ts` → `anthropic-cost.jsonl`, `anthropic-call-sites.json`
- `LIFEOS/TOOLS/ComputeGap.ts` → `gap-history.jsonl`
- `LIFEOS/PULSE/Performance/cost-aggregator.ts` → `session-costs.jsonl`
- `LIFEOS/PULSE/modules/syslog.ts` → `unifi-syslog.jsonl`
- `skills/_HOMESECURITY/Tools/HomeSensorDetector.ts` → `home-sensor.jsonl`, `perimeter.jsonl`
- `skills/_NETWORK/Tools/Speedtest.ts` → `speedtest.jsonl`

### VOICE/ — Voice Notification Log

**What populates it:** Pulse `pulse.ts` voice handler on every ElevenLabs notify call.
**Content:** Voice event audit trail (timestamps, voice_id, message, status).
**Format:** `voice-events.jsonl` (append-only).
**Purpose:** Reconstruct what {{DA_NAME}} said when, debug voice flakiness, charge-back ElevenLabs spend.

### RELATIONSHIP/ — {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}↔{{DA_NAME}} Interaction History

**What populates it:**
- (historical) the RelationshipMemory hook wrote daily notes — deleted in the 7.0.0 dead-code wave; notes remain readable

**Content:** Daily relationship notes (mood, micro-events, opinions {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} shared).
**Format:** `RELATIONSHIP/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
**Purpose:** Long-term context {{DA_NAME}} uses to remain in-relationship across sessions. Surfaced at session start by `LoadContext.hook.ts` (Recent Relationship Notes block).

### VERIFICATION/ — Cross-Vendor Audit Findings

**What populates it:** `LIFEOS/TOOLS/CrossVendorAudit.ts` (Forge audit-mode pipeline).
**Content:** Forge audit-mode findings on Algorithm E4/E5 ISAs (cross-vendor blind-spot detection via GPT-5.6 Sol). The log file keeps its legacy name `cato-findings.jsonl` for backward compatibility.
**Format:** `cato-findings.jsonl`.
**Purpose:** Audit trail for the cross-vendor verification pipeline.

### TEAMS/ — Team Configuration

**What populates it:** Team management workflows; `TeammateIdle.hook.ts` writes teammate-event metadata that overlaps with OBSERVABILITY but membership/config snapshots live here.
**Content:** Team membership snapshots organized by team name (architecture/, content/, design/, engineering/, marketing/).
**Format:** Markdown + JSON per team directory.
**Purpose:** Persistent record of which agents make up which teams, used by ComposeAgent and team workflows.

### SKILLS/ — Skill Execution Telemetry

**What populates it:** Skill instrumentation; `skills/_LIFEOS/Tools/ShadowRelease.ts` writes test-run logs.
**Content:** Skill execution events (start/finish, duration, outcomes), shadow release test results.
**Format:** Append-only JSONL (`execution.jsonl`, `test-shadow-release.jsonl`).
**Purpose:** Observability into skill behavior across sessions; release-test history.

### PLANS/ — Implementation Plan Documents

**What populates it:** Manual writes during planning sessions, agent writes during ALGORITHM PLAN phase for multi-session work.
**Content:** Implementation plans (architecture, security-restructure, etc.) that span more than one session.
**Format:** Markdown files, slug-based filenames.
**Purpose:** Stable home for plans that need to outlive a single ISA work directory.

### REFERENCE/ — Reference Materials

**What populates it:** Manual writes.
**Content:** Specifications, primer documents, reference notes worth re-reading (algorithm specifications, project primers).
**Format:** Markdown.
**Purpose:** Long-lived reference material that is not knowledge (per the "look up by name" test) but is also not a per-session work artifact.

### BOOKMARKS/ — External Bookmark State

**What populates it:** `_X` skill PullBookmarks workflow.
**Content:** Bookmark sync state (CSV of pulled X/Twitter bookmarks, seen-IDs registry).
**Format:** `bookmarks.csv` + state files.
**Purpose:** Incremental bookmark ingestion without re-pulling history.

### DATA/ — Generic Skill Data Dumps

**What populates it:** Various skills that need to persist structured datasets (e.g. `_CRIMESTATS` writes to `DATA/CrimeStats/`).
**Content:** Per-skill data subdirectories with structured datasets.
**Format:** Per-skill (CSV, JSON, etc.).
**Purpose:** Catch-all for skill-produced data that is too generic for skill-private memory but isn't research output.

### SCRATCHPAD/ — Ad-Hoc Scratch

**What populates it:** Ad-hoc writes during exploratory work.
**Content:** Throwaway queries, drafts, experiments, search-result dumps that may or may not graduate to KNOWLEDGE/.
**Format:** Mixed.
**Purpose:** Working area; nothing here is durable knowledge.

### PROJECT/ — Singular Project Notes

**What populates it:** Ad-hoc writes during project-specific deep work.
**Content:** Per-project deep-dive notes that don't belong in `USER/PROJECTS.md` (which is the project registry).
**Format:** Markdown per project.
**Purpose:** Provide a memory home for project-specific reasoning that outgrows a single ISA but is not a published project doc. Distinct from `LIFEOS/USER/PROJECTS/`.

### ARCHIVE/ — Archived Memory Content

**What populates it:** Manual archival of legacy memory content.
**Content:** Whatever has been retired from the active memory tree but is worth keeping retrievable.
**Format:** Mixed.
**Purpose:** Quarantine zone for content that should not appear in active retrieval.

### AUTO/ — Reserved (legacy auto-memory location)

**Status:** Reserved. The auto-memory role moved to `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` in v7.4 (2026-03-31). This directory is retained as a stub with its README so the public release taxonomy stays stable; nothing currently writes to it. Content that would historically have landed here now lands in CC native memory.

### RAW/ — Reserved (legacy firehose location)

**Status:** Reserved. The firehose role moved to Claude Code's native `projects/` JSONL transcripts in v7.0 (2026-01-12). This directory is retained as a stub with its README so the public release taxonomy stays stable; nothing currently writes to it.

### SYSTEMUPDATES/ — Change History

**What populates it:** Manual via CreateUpdate.ts tool
**Content:** Canonical tracking of all system changes
**Purpose:** Track architectural decisions and system changes over time

## Drift Detection (Memory Inventory)

The `MemoryDirIntegrity.ts` handler (run from `DocIntegrity.hook.ts` on Stop) keeps the Directory Inventory table above honest. On every Stop where any system file changed, it:

1. Lists every directory under `~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/` (one level deep, excluding `.git`, `.DS_Store`, etc.)
2. Parses the Directory Inventory table in this file
3. Reports any directory on disk not in the table (**unknown subsystem**)
4. Reports any directory in the table not on disk (**missing subsystem** — only flagged for `active` rows; `reserved` rows are allowed to be empty or absent)
5. Logs to stderr with `[MemoryDirIntegrity]` tag and emits a `doc.integrity.memory_dir` event to `STATE/events.jsonl`

If the handler reports drift, the fix is to either (a) add the new subsystem to the inventory table above, or (b) remove the stray directory from disk. Drift is a soft warning; the hook never blocks.

## Migration History

**2026-05-01:** Memory System v8.1 — Full Subsystem Inventory + Drift Detection
- Documented all live core subsystems that had grown organically since v7.x: OBSERVABILITY/, VOICE/, RELATIONSHIP/, WISDOM/, TEAMS/, VERIFICATION/, SKILLS/, PLANS/, REFERENCE/, BOOKMARKS/, DATA/, SCRATCHPAD/, PROJECT/, ARCHIVE/.
- Added the **Directory Inventory** authoritative table (used by drift hook) — every MEMORY/ subdirectory is listed with class, status, purpose, and writers.
- Documented the `_X` skill-private convention and listed `_AIRGRADIENT/`, `_HELIOS/`, `_NETWORK/` so the drift hook recognizes them.
- Reclassified `AUTO/` and `RAW/` as **reserved** (their active roles were retired in v7.4 and v7.0 respectively but the directories still ship in the public-release taxonomy via `ShadowRelease.ts` FLAT_README_ROOTS).
- Added `MemoryDirIntegrity.ts` handler to `DocIntegrity.hook.ts` — diffs MEMORY/ on disk against this file's inventory table on every Stop and warns on drift. Same pattern as `DocCrossRefIntegrity.ts`.
- Reduced `MEMORY/README.md` to a stub redirecting to this canonical doc, ending the dual-doc drift between the v7.6 doc and the v8.0 README.
- No data was moved or deleted; this migration is documentation + drift detection only.

**2026-04-07:** Memory System v7.6 — Retrieval + Navigation + Mining + Temporal
- Added `MemoryRetriever.ts` — BM25-lite search across KNOWLEDGE/ with optional LLM compression via Inference.ts low. Returns compressed context within configurable token budget.
- Added `KnowledgeGraph.ts` — In-memory graph over KNOWLEDGE/ frontmatter tags, wikilinks, and related fields. BFS traversal, stats, hubs, related notes, tag search. Computed at query time, zero persistent storage.
- Added `--mine` flag to `SessionHarvester.ts` — Regex-based classification of conversation segments into decisions, preferences, milestones, problems. Candidates written to `KNOWLEDGE/_harvest-queue/` for review, never directly to KNOWLEDGE/.
- Added `valid_from`/`valid_until` optional frontmatter fields to all 4 entity types in `_schema.md` — Temporal fact validity tracking. Contradiction detector now skips note pairs with non-overlapping validity windows.
- Updated `KnowledgeHarvester.ts contradictions` command to check temporal fields before flagging pairs.
- Knowledge skill updated with `graph`, `retrieve`, and `mine` commands.
- Pulse wiki module's `/api/wiki/graph` endpoint uses wikilinks only; `KnowledgeGraph.ts` provides richer graph (tags + wikilinks + related fields) via CLI.
- Inspired by MemPalace (Ben Sigman) analysis — adapted 4 techniques to LifeOS's file-based architecture without adding vector DB, SQLite, or any opaque storage.

**2026-04-05:** Knowledge Archive v2.1 — Research entity type added

- Topic is now a tag on the entity, not a separate domain folder
- Strict schema per entity type defined in `_schema.md`
- Algorithm LEARN phase writes directly to KNOWLEDGE/ with proper schemas (no harvester intermediary needed)

- Added PreCompact hook to settings.json (matcher: `"*"` for auto + manual)
- Documented auto-dream (server-controlled consolidation feature)
- LifeOS hooks and auto-memory now coexist: hooks for structured domain events, auto-memory for unstructured learnings

**2026-02-22:** v7.2 — ISA Consolidation (v4.0 work directories)
- Consolidated META.yaml, ISC.json, THREAD.md into single ISA.md per work directory
- ISA.md frontmatter now holds session metadata (title, session_id, status, completed_at)
- ISC section in ISA (checkbox markdown) is the system of record for criteria

## Claude Code Auto-Memory & Auto-Dream

Harness auto-memory is intentionally disabled. LifeOS's own memory surfaces are the system of record.

### Auto-Memory (disabled by design)
Claude Code ships a built-in auto-memory feature: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/` with a `MEMORY.md` index and `feedback_*.md` files. LifeOS turns it off.

**Configuration (shipped):**
- `autoMemoryEnabled: false` in `settings.json` (mirrored in the release template `settings.public.json`)
- `permissions.deny` blocks `Write` and `Edit` on `~/.claude/projects/**/memory/**`

**Why:** since the v5.4.0 Unified Learning Router, all learning routes through LifeOS surfaces instead. Rules, preferences, and operational behavior get encoded where they're structurally enforced (CLAUDE.md, hooks, settings.json, skills); reusable knowledge goes to `MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/`; task state to `MEMORY/WORK/`; corrections and ratings to `MEMORY/LEARNING/`. A feedback memo in harness memory treats the symptom (the AI didn't remember) instead of the cause (the rule wasn't encoded where it lives) — see the system prompt's "Override of harness auto-memory" rule.

### Auto-Dream (Server-Controlled)
**Trigger:** Server-side feature flag — runs between sessions when 24+ hours and 5+ sessions have elapsed
**What it does:** Background subagent consolidates auto-memory files — prunes stale entries, resolves contradictions, converts relative dates, deduplicates

LifeOS doesn't control auto-dream activation. With auto-memory disabled there is nothing in that directory for it to consolidate.

### PreCompact Hook
**What:** Preserves active work context before conversation compaction
**Hook:** `PreCompact.hook.ts` (matcher: `"*"`)
**Captures:** Active task, ISA summary, files modified, key decisions, session ID
**Output:** Structured handover note on stdout, preserved through compaction

### LifeOS Memory Surfaces (harness auto-memory disabled)

| System | Writer | Content | Loaded When |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| LifeOS WORK/ | Algorithm + hooks | Task tracking, ISAs, ISC | On demand via LoadContext |
| LifeOS LEARNING/ | Hooks + harvesters | Ratings, failures, synthesis | On demand via dynamic context |
| LifeOS WISDOM/ | Algorithm LEARN + harvesters | Frames, principles, frame health | OBSERVE phase reads frames; on-demand |
| LifeOS RELATIONSHIP/ | RelationshipMemory hook | Daily {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}}↔{{DA_NAME}} notes | LoadContext (recent notes block) |
| LifeOS OBSERVABILITY/ | Many hooks | Tool activity, costs, config audits | Pulse dashboards |
| LifeOS VOICE/ | Pulse voice handler | Voice notification audit | On demand |
| LifeOS STATE/ | Hooks | Ephemeral runtime state | On demand |
| PreCompact | Hook | Work-in-progress handover | Before compaction |

### Retrieval absence statements + tag-match semantics (2026-06-10)

Both retrieval CLIs now state absence affirmatively instead of returning silence: `MemoryRetriever.ts` prints `No prior work found on "<query>" in the knowledge corpus.` and ContextSearch prints an equivalent line naming its five searched sources. Implemented in the retrieval layer — the model is never asked to assert absences it can't know.

Semantic change in `MemoryRetriever.ts` tag matching: reverse containment (query-term ⊇ tag) now requires tag length ≥ 4. Short tags (`ai`, `sec`) still match via exact/forward containment; what's gone is garbage terms swallowing short tags, which had made the zero-hit branch unreachable.
