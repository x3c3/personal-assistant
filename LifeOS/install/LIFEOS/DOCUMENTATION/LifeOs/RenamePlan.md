# RenamePlan — LifeOS → LifeOS

> The staged plan for renaming the system and (eventually) the public repo to **LifeOS**. The machine-readable companion is `RenameMap.json` in this directory — rename tooling AND the privacy/scrub gates consume that file, never hardcoded token lists. Full inventory evidence: `LIFEOS/MEMORY/WORK/20260613-lifeos-refocus-and-system-cleanup/analysis/naming.md`.

## The one rule

**A half-rename is a silent privacy regression, worse than breakage.** A scrub gate that greps for a token that no longer exists passes vacuously. Every rename stage therefore updates the gates in the same change, off `RenameMap.json`.

## Status

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Casing standardization** | `LifeOS` prose standard (retire `Life OS`, keep `LifeOs` for PascalCase files only) | DONE 2026-06-13 (core files; fleet wave with rename-now) |
| **Rename-now (framing)** | Docs prose/branding (class 1), Pulse UI display strings (class 2 minus app bundle + logo asset), core identity files (system prompt, CLAUDE.md, thesis, architecture master) | IN PROGRESS 2026-06-13 |
| **Rename-at-cut** | `LIFEOS/` dir + ~4K path refs (compat symlink), `PAI_*` env keys (read-fallback shims), `<your-release-skill>` skill via CreateSkill, repo URLs (the GitHub rename IS the cut), mode banners + hook regexes, menubar app bundle, logo asset | QUEUED — gated on cut preconditions |
| **Post-cut optional** | Code identifiers (194 occurrences) | QUEUED — mechanical, can lag indefinitely |

## What changed now (framing wave)

- LifeOS is the primary identity in LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md, CLAUDE.md, LifeOsThesis.md, LifeosSystemArchitecture.md (+ regenerated ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md) — zero rule/gate/template semantics changed; the three mode-banner literals stay byte-identical until the cut (pinned by OutputFormatGate + DriftReminder hooks).
- Pulse display strings say LifeOS; bundle name, asset paths, routes, env untouched.
- Docs subsystem intros tie each subsystem to the current→ideal-state loop.

## Cut preconditions (all must hold — see RenameMap.json `cut_preconditions`)

1. The LifeOS sensor loop (R3–R7 from the 2026-06-13 MasterReport) is demonstrably running — the rename is then a formality, not a migration.
2. In-flight forks reconciled: `.claude-fable` v7, skill-only shadow release (release root = `LifeOS/` skill only, no full `.claude/` clone and no root `install.sh`), 5.0.0/5.1.0 shadow releases.
3. Scrub gates read RenameMap.json programmatically.
4. Rehearsal in a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` clone passes its migration ISA (per-path probes: launchd agents alive, symlink chain intact, two-repo sync green, statusline rendering, Pulse healthy).
5. GitHub rename redirect verified (stars + clone URLs survive); never create a new repo named LifeOS afterward.

## Cut-day runbook (summary)

1. Freeze: no other sessions; checkpoint commit both private repos.
2. Atomic GitHub rename of the public repo (separate decision/moment from the private-tree changes; public repo content changes remain out of scope until then).
3. Private tree: `LIFEOS/` → new dir name in one operation + `LifeOS → <new>` compat symlink; env shims in; launchd plists rewritten + kickstarted; settings.json paths swept; banners + hook regexes + tests changed in one coordinated commit.
4. Sweep classes 6/7 (repo URLs, `<your-release-skill>` skill rename via CreateSkill).
5. Probe pass: migration ISA per-path probes + `bun test` (hooks/ cwd) + Interceptor screenshot of Pulse + Telegram smoke + a probe on every LifeOS worker machine in the fleet.
6. Shadow-release restage + 14 gates against the renamed tree before any future public publish.
