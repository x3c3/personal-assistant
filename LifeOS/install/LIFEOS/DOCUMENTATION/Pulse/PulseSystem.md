# The Pulse System

**Pulse is the Life Dashboard.** It is the visible surface of the LifeOS Life Operating System — the place where you (and your DA) see and interact with everything the OS is doing. LifeOS is the OS; Pulse is how you watch it run.

Every Pulse module is a sub-surface of the Dashboard: real-time observability, voice notifications, chat surfaces (iMessage/Telegram), scheduled work, background worker state, DA heartbeat, and — as the dashboard grows — live views of current state vs ideal state, goal progress, workflows, and day-in-the-life preview. A LifeOS with no dashboard would still be a LifeOS; Pulse is what keeps it visible.

**Canonical thesis:** `LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/LifeOs/LifeOsThesis.md` — the source of truth for what LifeOS is, what the DA is, and why Pulse exists.

**Implementation:** The unified daemon of LifeOS — a single always-on process that handles cron jobs, voice notifications, hook validation, observability APIs + dashboard, Telegram chat, iMessage chat, and GitHub work polling. Pulse is THE local runtime for all LifeOS services. It absorbed VoiceServer, TelegramBot, the iMessage bot, and the Observability server into crash-isolated modules running under one process, one port (31337), and one launchd plist (`com.lifeos.pulse`).

**Version:** 2.0 (2026-04-01)
**Location:** `~/.claude/LIFEOS/PULSE/`

## Subsystems

Each subsystem runs in its own crash-isolated loop within the single Pulse process. If one module crashes (e.g., Telegram loses connection), all other modules continue running uninterrupted.

| Module | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Cron** | Scheduled jobs -- the original heartbeat loop | `pulse.ts` |
| **Voice** | ElevenLabs TTS notifications | `VoiceServer/voice.ts` |
| **Hooks** | Skill-guard and agent-guard validation | `modules/hooks.ts` |
| **Observability** | Data APIs + Observatory dashboard + security management APIs (absorbed from observability-server.ts) | `Observability/observability.ts` |
| **Telegram** | grammY polling bot — per-turn LifeOS memory injection, claude-agent-sdk session, dynamic Sonnet-summarize → ElevenLabs voice-summary reply, 60-min idle-session boundary. See "Telegram Voice Pipeline" below. | `modules/telegram.ts` |
| **iMessage** | SQLite polling bot with claude-agent-sdk sessions (absorbed from the iMessage bot, disabled by default) | `modules/imessage.ts` |
| **Worker** | GitHub Issues work polling for LifeOS Workers (optional) | `checks/github-work.ts` |
| **Assistant** | Digital Assistant identity, heartbeat, scheduling, growth | `Assistant/module.ts` |
| **UserIndex** | LifeOS USER/ indexer — parses frontmatter + collections into typed JSON; fs.watch live refresh; powers `/life` dashboard + Daemon publish feed | `modules/user-index.ts` |
| **Doctor** | Read-only System Health surface (2026-07-12, #1461). Serves `GET /api/doctor` → `{ manifest, heartbeat, reconcile }` from the advisory caches written by `LIFEOS/TOOLS/Doctor.ts`; shells `Doctor.ts --reconcile` (30s cache). Holds zero truth of its own. Rendered by `SystemHealthPanel.tsx` on the **System → Hooks** page: capability states + fix commands, doctor heartbeat age (red past 7 days — a dead checker must be loud), and hook reconciliation. Diagnostic register, no scores. | `modules/doctor.ts` |

## Telegram Voice Pipeline

The Telegram module is the most opinionated chat surface in Pulse — it's the one that has to feel *alive*. When the principal sends a message from their phone, the bot threads four loops together: memory awareness (knows who the principal is and what's in flight), tool agency (can read mail, run skills, send messages), continuity (resumes recent threads), and audible identity (replies as the principal's DA, in the DA's voice). The pipeline is intentionally a slightly higher-touch path than other Pulse modules because chat is where the conversational-agent feel lives.

### Per-turn flow

```
message:text receive (grammY polling)
  ↓
allowlist middleware (bot.use) — reject unauthorized senders BEFORE handler
  ↓
sanitize() + analyzeForInjection() — CRITICAL-risk messages are blocked here
  ↓
processing-busy lock — sequential per-chat
  ↓
idle-session-boundary check:
    if (Date.now() - lastMessageAt > IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS) {
      lastSessionId = undefined
      threadStartedAt = Date.now()
    }
  ↓
sendChatAction(chatId, "typing")
  ↓
buildLifeosContextBlock() — cached 60s w/ mtime invalidation, reads:
    USER/DIGITAL_ASSISTANT/DA_IDENTITY.md
    USER/PRINCIPAL/PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md
    USER/TELOS/PRINCIPAL_TELOS.md
    USER/PROJECTS.md "Open Sessions to Resume" slice
    today's date / TZ
  ↓
SDK query() with:
    tools: { type: "preset", preset: "claude_code" }
    settingSources: ["user", "project"]   // skip "local" (no CLAUDE.md format curls)
    systemPrompt.append = contextBlock + Telegram-mode rules
    prompt = filtered "Previous conversation:" history (timestamp >= threadStartedAt) + sanitized message
    resume: lastSessionId   // dropped on idle boundary
  ↓
streaming editMessageText updates (live cursor)
  ↓
final ctx.reply()/editMessageText() — text reply ships
  ↓
conversationStore.addExchange() + appendChatLog()
  ↓
lastMessageAt = now   // thread is alive
  ↓
sendVoiceSummary(ctx, fullText) — fire-and-forget IIFE
    ├─ short-reply skip (<8 words → no voice)
    ├─ summarizeForVoice(): Inference.ts level:"medium" (sonnet-tier) with 10s outer race
    │     fallback: first-sentence regex if timeout/failure
    │     returns { summary, source: "inference" | "fallback" }
    ├─ useless-fallback skip (source=="fallback" && fallback<6 words && reply>=25 words)
    ├─ synthesizeKaiVoice(): ElevenLabs output_format=opus_48000_64 → Buffer
    └─ bot.api.sendVoice(InputFile(buf, "kai-summary.ogg")) — voice-bubble bubble
```

### Key contracts

| Concern | Mechanism | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Voice identity | `KAI_VOICE_ID` resolved at module import from `settings.json` `daidentity.voices.main.voiceId` (same source `VoiceServer` reads) | Public Rachel voice (`21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`) is the fallback for fresh installs that haven't populated settings.json. No hardcoded principal-specific literal; release portability without install-time placeholder resolution. |
| Channel separation | Telegram never calls `/notify`; CLI `/notify` never calls `bot.api.sendVoice`; VoiceServer unmodified by this pipeline | Three layers of defense, in order of failure mode they catch: (1) `env: { LIFEOS_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL: "telegram" }` on `sdkOptions` propagates to every hook in the subprocess tree — `hooks/VoiceCompletion.hook.ts`, `hooks/PromptProcessing.hook.ts` voice-announcement block (StopFailureHandler merged into EventLogger 2026-07-11), and `hooks/handlers/DocCrossRefIntegrity.ts` all check `isDesktopChannel()` and skip the `/notify` fetch (writing `event_type: 'skipped'` to `voice-events.jsonl` with `reason: 'remote_channel:telegram'`). This is the *hard* barrier — it stops desktop voice at the call site, regardless of what the model is doing. (2) `canUseTool` callback denies any Bash command containing `31337` or `/notify` from the model itself. (3) The Telegram-mode system-prompt rule forbidding `/notify` curls. Layers 2 and 3 are belt-and-suspenders; layer 1 is the load-bearing fix (added 2026-05-24, ISA `MEMORY/WORK/20260524-telegram-voice-channel-isolation-vs-hermes/ISA.md`). Source of truth: `hooks/lib/notification-channel.ts`. |
| Minimalist remote-channel output | Telegram + iMessage receive plain conversational prose — no CLAUDE.md mode banners (`MINIMAL`/`NATIVE`/`ALGORITHM`), no template fields (`📃 CONTENT:`, `🗣️ {{DA_NAME}}:`), no Algorithm phase headers (`═══`, `━━━`). | Two layers: (1) **Prevention** — the Router hook (`TheRouter.hook.ts`, retired 2026-07-11) short-circuited when `LIFEOS_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL` is set to a remote channel and emits `TELEGRAM_DIRECTIVE` / `IMESSAGE_DIRECTIVE` into `additionalContext` instead of the `MODE:` banner. The model never sees `MODE: ALGORITHM` so doesn't reach for the template. Per-channel ephemeral system prompts get injected at runtime. (2) **Egress sanitizer** — `LIFEOS/PULSE/lib/strip-mode-scaffolding.ts` `stripModeScaffolding()` regex-strips known LifeOS scaffolding markers from `fullText` before `editMessageText` / `reply` / `sendMessage` / `summarizeForVoice`. Telegram + iMessage both apply at the end of their respective SDK loops. On a sanitizer hit, `log("warn", "egress sanitizer stripped mode scaffolding", ...)` records the leak for tuning the Layer 1 directive. (Added 2026-05-24 iteration 2.) |
| Memory context | Per-turn `buildLifeosContextBlock()`, module-level cache `cachedContext: { text, builtAt, mtimes }`, 60s TTL, per-source-file mtime invalidation | Stale only across a Pulse restart or genuine source-file change. PROJECTS.md is sliced to "Open Sessions to Resume" only; the rest is reachable on-demand via SDK Read. |
| Idle-session boundary | `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 60 * 60 * 1000` (1 hour). `lastMessageAt` updated ONLY after fully-successful exchange (not at handler entry — a slow SDK reply during which the next message arrives shouldn't pre-update the clock) | Restart-equivalent: `startTelegram()` initializes `lastMessageAt = null` and `threadStartedAt = Date.now()`, treating fresh boot as fresh thread. Persisted `conversations.json` is untouched — only the per-turn slice is filtered. |
| Useless-fallback guard | `MIN_FALLBACK_WORDS = 6`, `MEANINGFUL_REPLY_WORDS = 25` — when Sonnet times out and the fallback is a stylistic short intro (e.g., "Busy day.") on a substantive reply, skip ElevenLabs entirely. No voice beats a 0:00 voice stub. | Logged at `info` level with `{ msg: "voice summary skipped — useless fallback against long reply", fallbackSummary, fallbackWords, replyWords, chatId }`. |
| Single-user assumption | `lastSessionId` / `lastMessageAt` / `threadStartedAt` are module-global. Matches existing `lastSessionId` shape. | Allowlist > 1 chat → state must move to `Map<chatId, …>` keyed per chat. Comment in source. |

### Release portability (shadow-release readiness)

- `modules/telegram.ts` ships **zero** principal-identifiable literals (no chat IDs, no bot tokens, no principal-specific names). `DenyListCheck` reports 0 real-leaks.
- Voice ID is read from `settings.json` at module import, not hardcoded — so no `{{...}}` placeholder needs install-time resolution; the setup-time template substitution doesn't need to know about this module.
- USER bootstrap templates for the four context-block sources exist at `skills/_LIFEOS/RELEASE_TEMPLATES/USER/{DIGITAL_ASSISTANT/DA_IDENTITY.md, PRINCIPAL/PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md, TELOS/PRINCIPAL_TELOS.md, PROJECTS.md}` — a fresh install runs functional from day one, even before `/interview` populates the principal's real content.

### Adjacent gotchas

- **Module load order matters for ELEVENLABS_API_KEY scrubbing.** Telegram imports first in Pulse; if it deletes `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` from `process.env` at import time, VoiceServer's later init reads `apiKeyConfigured: false` and the CLI `/notify` channel goes dark. Telegram captures the key into a module-local const but does NOT delete from env. (The Anthropic-key scrubs at module top do still delete — those keys have a single consumer; the ElevenLabs key has two.)
- **disallowedTools shape gotcha.** The SDK's `disallowedTools?: string[]` field accepts tool **names** (`"Bash"`, `"Read"`), not glob patterns like `"Bash(curl *31337/notify*)"` (that's Claude Code's `settings.json permissions.deny` syntax). An earlier attempt to backstop the prompt-level `/notify` ban via `disallowedTools` patterns was silently ignored by the SDK. The hard barrier is now the `LIFEOS_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL` env-var channel gate inside each voice-firing hook (see "Channel separation" row above) — `canUseTool` stops the model from calling /notify directly, but the env gate stops the hooks themselves from leaking even when the model behaves perfectly. The two together close every path: model→Bash→/notify blocked by canUseTool; SDK subprocess→Stop hook→/notify blocked by the env gate.
- **SDK subprocess Stop hooks were the actual desktop-voice leak.** Discovered 2026-05-24: even with `canUseTool` blocking model-initiated `/notify` calls, the SDK subprocess's own Stop / StopFailure / UserPromptSubmit events fired the user-level hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, four of which POST to `localhost:31337/notify`. `voice-events.jsonl` showed Telegram replies (e.g., "can't write from Telegram. Open a terminal session.") being played on the desktop speaker. Fixed by propagating `LIFEOS_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL=telegram` via `sdkOptions.env` so the hooks themselves can detect the remote channel and skip — see `hooks/lib/notification-channel.ts` and the "Channel separation" row above.
- **Sonnet via Inference.ts is slower than naive estimates.** Real measured cost is 4-6 seconds for short-summary tasks (claude CLI subprocess spawn + actual inference). The outer race was originally 3.5s — too tight, fired routinely. Now 10s. Total post-text voice latency is typically 5-8s.

### Doctrine cross-refs

- Inference.ts: `LIFEOS/TOOLS/Inference.ts` (CLI + library contract)
- VoiceServer: `LIFEOS/PULSE/VoiceServer/voice.ts` (CLI `/notify` channel)
- ConversationStore: `LIFEOS/PULSE/lib/conversation.ts` (`getHistory(): ConversationMessage[]` — timestamp surfaced for the idle filter)
- ShadowRelease substitution map: `skills/_LIFEOS/Tools/ShadowRelease.ts:482` (legacy `<principal-voice-id> → {{LIFEOS_MAIN_VOICE_ID}}` rule still ships as defense-in-depth, but the live module no longer relies on it)

## Architecture

Pulse is a single Bun process managed by launchd on port 31337. On startup, it initializes all enabled subsystem modules (voice, hooks, observability, telegram, imessage), starts the HTTP server, launches the menu bar app, then enters the cron heartbeat loop. It reads job definitions from `PULSE.toml`, evaluates cron schedules, executes due jobs (either shell scripts or Claude CLI invocations), and routes output through internal dispatch (voice is now an in-process function call, not a separate HTTP request). There is no queue, no AI triage layer, no channel abstraction -- just run jobs and route output.

```
launchd (com.lifeos.pulse)
    |
    v
pulse.ts  (heartbeat loop)
    |
    +-- loadConfig() <-- PULSE.toml
    |
    +-- readState()  <-- state/state.json
    |
    +-- for each enabled job:
    |       |
    |       +-- isDue(schedule, now, lastRun)?
    |       |       |
    |       |       no --> skip
    |       |       |
    |       |       yes
    |       |       v
    |       +-- circuit breaker (3 consecutive failures --> skip)
    |       |
    |       +-- execute:
    |       |       script --> spawnScript(command)
    |       |       claude --> spawnClaude(prompt, model)
    |       |
    |       +-- isSentinel(output)?
    |       |       yes --> log "nothing to report", no dispatch
    |       |       no  --> dispatch(output, target)
    |       |
    |       +-- writeState() (atomic, after each job)
    |
    +-- smart sleep (next due time, capped at 60s)
    |
    +-- loop
```

## How It Works

### The Heartbeat Loop

Pulse runs an infinite loop. Each tick:

1. **Iterate** over every enabled job in `PULSE.toml`.
2. **Evaluate** each job's cron schedule against the current time.
3. **Check** the circuit breaker (skip if 3+ consecutive failures).
4. **Execute** the job (script or claude).
5. **Inspect** the output for sentinel values.
6. **Dispatch** non-sentinel output to the configured channel.
7. **Persist** state to disk after each job (atomic write).
8. **Sleep** until the next job is due, capped at 60 seconds for SIGTERM responsiveness.

### Job Evaluation

A job runs when two conditions are met:

- **Cron match:** The 5-field cron expression matches the current minute, hour, day, month, and weekday.
- **Dedup guard:** The job has not already run in the current minute (prevents double-execution within the same cron window).

The cron parser supports standard syntax: `*`, ranges (`1-5`), steps (`*/5`), lists (`1,3,5`), and combinations (`0-30/10`).

### Smart Sleep

After processing all jobs, Pulse computes how many milliseconds until the next job is due by scanning the next 60 minutes of cron windows. It sleeps for that duration, capped at 60 seconds (so SIGTERM is handled promptly). Minimum sleep is 1 second to avoid busy-looping.

---

## PULSE.toml Format

All jobs are defined in a single TOML file. Each job is a `[[job]]` table array entry.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | -- | Unique job identifier |
| `schedule` | string | yes | -- | 5-field cron expression |
| `type` | `"script"` or `"claude"` | no | `"script"` | Execution method |
| `command` | string | for script | -- | Shell command to run (supports `${ENV_VAR}` expansion) |
| `prompt` | string | for claude | -- | Prompt text sent to Claude CLI |
| `model` | string | no | `"sonnet"` | Claude model for claude-type jobs |
| `output` | `"voice"` / `"telegram"` / `"ntfy"` / `"log"` | no | `"log"` | Dispatch target for non-sentinel output |
| `enabled` | boolean | no | `true` | Whether the job runs |

### Module Configuration Sections

In addition to `[[job]]` entries, `PULSE.toml` contains configuration sections for each subsystem module:

| Section | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `[voice]` | ElevenLabs TTS | `enabled`, `voice_id`, `default_voice_enabled` |
| `[telegram]` | Telegram bot | `enabled`, `bot_token` (or env var), `principal_chat_id` |
| `[imessage]` | iMessage bot | `enabled` (default `false`), `poll_interval_ms` |
| `[observability]` | Observatory dashboard + data/security APIs | `enabled`, `dashboard_path` (symlink to Observability/out) |
| `[hooks]` | Hook validation | `enabled`, `skill_guard`, `agent_guard` |

### Example

```toml
[voice]
enabled = true
voice_id = "<YOUR_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID>"

[telegram]
enabled = true

[imessage]
enabled = false

[observability]
enabled = true

[hooks]
enabled = true

[[job]]
name = "calendar-reminder"
schedule = "*/10 * * * *"
type = "script"
command = "bun run checks/calendar.ts"
output = "voice"
enabled = true

[[job]]
name = "morning-brief"
schedule = "0 7 * * *"
type = "claude"
prompt = "Prepare a morning brief: today's calendar events..."
model = "sonnet"
output = "voice"
enabled = true
```

---

## Job Types

### Script Jobs (`type = "script"`)

Run a shell command via `bash -c`. The working directory is `~/.claude/Pulse/`. Environment variables from `~/.claude/.env` are available. The process has a 60-second timeout (SIGTERM on expiry).

Cost: $0. All computation is local or uses free APIs.

Script jobs are the default and should be preferred. Most checks follow a pattern: call an API, parse the response, output a notification string or a sentinel.

### Claude Jobs (`type = "claude"`)

Spawn `claude` headless via the `LIFEOS/TOOLS/Inference.ts` flag pattern (`--print --model X --tools '' --output-format text --setting-sources '' --system-prompt ''`) with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` deleted from the subprocess env so OAuth/keychain billing applies. The prompt is piped via stdin. Output format is plain text. The process has a 5-minute timeout. **NEVER use `claude --bare`** — the `--bare` flag forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` auth and bypasses OAuth/keychain (per the constitutional rule in `LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` "Operational Rules" — a real billing incident drove this rule).

Cost: Token-dependent. A Haiku job costs fractions of a cent. A Sonnet job processing a morning brief costs roughly $0.01-0.03.

Claude jobs are for tasks that require reasoning: urgency assessment, summarization, pattern detection. Use them sparingly -- most checks should be script jobs with optional AI triage as a second layer.

---

## Output Routing

When a job produces output, it is dispatched to one of four targets:

| Target | Destination | Max Length | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `voice` | Internal voice module (`http://localhost:31337/notify`) | 500 chars | Spoken aloud via ElevenLabs; same process, internal function call |
| `telegram` | Telegram Bot API | 4096 chars | Requires `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_PRINCIPAL_CHAT_ID` in `.env` |
| `ntfy` | ntfy.sh push notification | 4096 chars | Requires `NTFY_TOPIC` in `.env` |
| `log` | stdout (already logged by main loop) | unlimited | Default; no external dispatch |

All dispatch calls have a 10-second timeout and fail gracefully -- a dispatch failure does not mark the job as failed.

---

## Sentinel Pattern

Checks often find nothing to report. Rather than dispatching empty or low-value notifications, check scripts output a **sentinel value** to suppress dispatch entirely.

Recognized sentinels:

| Sentinel | Typical Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `NO_ACTION` | GitHub: no new PRs or activity |
| `NO_URGENT` | Email: no urgent messages |
| `NO_EVENTS` | Calendar: no upcoming meetings |
| `HEARTBEAT_OK` | Generic: system is healthy, nothing to report (legacy sentinel, still recognized) |

An empty string also suppresses dispatch.

When the main loop detects a sentinel, it logs "nothing to report" and skips the dispatch call. The job is still recorded as successful in state.

Check scripts should always output a sentinel on their "nothing to report" path rather than exiting silently. This makes the protocol explicit and debuggable.

---

## Circuit Breaker

If a job fails 3 consecutive times, Pulse stops running it and logs a warning on each tick:

```
Skipping email-triage: 3 consecutive failures
```

The failure counter resets to 0 on any successful run. To recover a tripped breaker:

1. Fix the underlying issue.
2. Either restart Pulse (`manage.sh restart`) or manually edit `state/state.json` to reset `consecutiveFailures` to 0.

The threshold is hardcoded at `MAX_FAILURES = 3` in `pulse.ts`.

---

## State Management

### state.json

Located at `~/.claude/Pulse/state/state.json`. Written atomically (write to `.tmp`, rename) after each job execution.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "startedAt": 1743451200000,
  "jobs": {
    "email-triage": {
      "lastRun": 1743451500000,
      "lastResult": "ok",
      "consecutiveFailures": 0
    },
    "healthcheck": {
      "lastRun": 1743451500000,
      "lastResult": "error",
      "consecutiveFailures": 2
    }
  }
}
```

Fields per job:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `lastRun` | Unix timestamp (ms) of last execution |
| `lastResult` | `"ok"` or `"error"` |
| `consecutiveFailures` | Counter; resets on success, increments on failure |

If `state.json` is missing or corrupt, Pulse starts with an empty state. All jobs will be considered overdue and run on the first tick.

### Auxiliary State Files

Individual check scripts may maintain their own state files in `state/`:

| File | Used By | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `email-seen.json` | `checks/email.ts` | Dedup list of seen email IDs (max 200) |
| `github-seen.json` | `checks/github.ts` | Dedup list of seen PR keys (max 500) |
| `pulse.pid` | `pulse.ts` | Current process ID |

---

## Process Lifecycle

### launchd Integration

Pulse is managed by macOS launchd via `com.lifeos.pulse.plist`. Key properties:

| Property | Value | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `RunAtLoad` | `true` | Starts on login |
| `KeepAlive` | `true` | Auto-restarts on crash |
| `ThrottleInterval` | `30` | Minimum 30 seconds between restart attempts |
| `WorkingDirectory` | `~/.claude/Pulse` | CWD for the process |

Logs go to `~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stdout.log` and `pulse-stderr.log`.

### Startup

1. launchd spawns `bun run pulse.ts`.
2. Pulse writes its PID to `state/pulse.pid`.
3. Loads `PULSE.toml` and `state/state.json`.
4. Initializes all enabled subsystem modules (voice, hooks, observability, telegram, imessage).
5. Starts the HTTP server on port 31337.
6. Launches the menu bar app (`LifeOS Pulse.app`) automatically.
7. Logs enabled job/module count and names.
8. Enters the cron heartbeat loop.

### Shutdown

Pulse registers handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. On signal:

1. Sets `shuttingDown = true`.
2. The current tick completes (no new jobs start).
3. Final state is persisted to disk.
4. Process exits cleanly.

### Crash Recovery

If Pulse crashes, launchd restarts it within 30 seconds (ThrottleInterval). On restart, state is loaded from disk -- jobs that were overdue during the downtime will run on the first tick. No data is lost because state is written after each job, not at shutdown.

---

## Adding and Modifying Jobs

### Adding a New Script Job

1. Create the check script in `checks/`:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env bun
// checks/my-check.ts

async function main() {
  // Do your check
  const result = await someCheck()

  if (!result) {
    console.log("NO_ACTION")
    return
  }

  // Output a human-readable notification
  console.log("Something happened that needs attention")
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(`my-check error: ${err}`)
  console.log("NO_ACTION")
})
```

2. Add the job to `PULSE.toml`:

```toml
[[job]]
name = "my-check"
schedule = "*/15 * * * *"
type = "script"
command = "bun run checks/my-check.ts"
output = "telegram"
enabled = true
```

3. Restart Pulse: `~/.claude/Pulse/manage.sh restart`

### Modifying an Existing Job

Edit `PULSE.toml` and restart Pulse. The state for renamed jobs will not carry over -- the old job's state remains in `state.json` as dead weight (harmless) and the new job starts fresh.

### Disabling a Job

Set `enabled = false` in `PULSE.toml` and restart. The job's state is preserved in case it is re-enabled.

---

## Check Scripts

### email.ts -- Email Triage

**Schedule:** Every 5 minutes
**Output:** voice
**Cost:** $0 when no new emails; ~$0.001 per triage (Haiku)

Two-layer design:
1. **Layer 1 (free):** Fetches unread emails via the `_INBOX` skill's `Manage.ts` tool. Deduplicates against a seen list (`state/email-seen.json`, max 200 entries). If no new emails, outputs `NO_URGENT`.
2. **Layer 2 (cheap):** Sends new email subjects/senders to Haiku for urgency assessment. Only flags genuinely urgent items: security incidents, 24-hour deadlines, explicit ASAP requests, financial/medical alerts. Newsletters, meeting invites, and routine updates are not urgent.

### calendar.ts -- Calendar Reminders

**Schedule:** Every 10 minutes
**Output:** voice
**Cost:** $0

Fetches events from all Google Calendars within a 30-minute lookahead window via the Google Calendar API. Deduplicates by event ID across calendars. Formats up to 3 upcoming events as spoken notifications ("Team standup in 12 minutes. Design review in 25 minutes."). Outputs `NO_EVENTS` when the window is clear.

### github.ts -- GitHub PR Monitor

**Schedule:** Every 30 minutes
**Output:** telegram
**Cost:** $0

Monitors open PRs across the repositories you configure. Deduplicates against a seen list (`state/github-seen.json`, max 500 entries). Reports new PRs with repo, number, title, and author. Outputs `NO_ACTION` when there is no new activity.

### health.ts -- Website Health Check

**Schedule:** Every 5 minutes
**Output:** ntfy
**Cost:** $0

Sends HTTP HEAD requests to the sites you configure with 10-second timeouts. Reports failures with status codes or error messages. Outputs `NO_ACTION` when all sites are healthy.

## Relationship to Claude Code /schedule

Claude Code has a built-in `/schedule` command that creates remote agents running on a cron schedule. These are **session-scoped triggers** -- they run as full Claude Code sessions in the cloud, have access to your codebase context, and are managed through Claude Code's interface.

Pulse is different:

| | Pulse | /schedule |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs** | Locally, always-on daemon | Remote, cloud-based |
| **Scope** | Lightweight checks, monitoring | Full Claude Code sessions |
| **Cost** | $0 for script jobs | Full session token cost |
| **Persistence** | Survives reboots (launchd) | Managed by Claude Code |
| **Use case** | Email, calendar, health checks | Complex recurring analysis |

There is no conflict. Pulse handles high-frequency, low-cost local monitoring. /schedule handles heavy, infrequent cloud work. They can coexist and even complement each other (e.g., Pulse detects an issue, /schedule runs deeper analysis).

---

## Relationship to Old Monitor

Pulse replaces LifeOS Monitor entirely. Monitor was a 3,283-line TypeScript system with:

- A channel-based pub/sub architecture
- An AI triage layer for routing decisions
- A queue system with priority scheduling
- Complex lifecycle management
- Multiple abstraction layers

It was built for a future that never arrived and had been dormant for months.

Pulse does the same useful work in ~1,050 lines across 9 files, with no abstractions beyond what the jobs require. The old Monitor directory should be considered archived.

Pulse also replaces the ScheduledTasks system, which used individual shell scripts and multiple launchd plists for each task. Pulse consolidates all scheduled work into a single daemon with a single plist and a single configuration file.

As of v2.0, Pulse also absorbed four previously standalone services into its module system: VoiceServer (ElevenLabs TTS, formerly port 8888), the Observability server (data APIs + Observatory dashboard), TelegramBot (grammY polling), and the iMessage bot (SQLite polling). Each runs as a crash-isolated module under the single Pulse process on port 31337.

---

## Cost Model

### Script Jobs: $0

Email, calendar, GitHub, and health checks use free APIs (Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub REST, HTTP HEAD). The only cost is local compute (negligible).

The email check has an optional AI layer (Haiku urgency triage) that fires only when new emails arrive. Cost: ~$0.001 per invocation.

### Claude Jobs: Token Cost

| Job | Model | Schedule | Est. Cost/Run | Est. Cost/Day |
|-----|-------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| morning-brief | Sonnet | 1x daily (7 AM) | ~$0.02 | ~$0.02 |
| memory-consolidation | Sonnet | 1x daily (3 AM) | ~$0.03 | ~$0.03 |
| proactive-suggestions | Haiku | 3x daily (disabled) | ~$0.005 | ~$0.015 |

**Total estimated daily cost with current enabled jobs:** ~$0.05/day + negligible email triage costs.

With all jobs enabled including proactive-suggestions: ~$0.065/day.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Check Status

```bash
~/.claude/Pulse/manage.sh status
```

Shows PID, uptime, and per-job last run times with failure counts.

### View Logs

```bash
# Recent stdout (structured JSON)
tail -50 ~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stdout.log

# Recent errors
tail -50 ~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stderr.log

# Follow live
tail -f ~/.claude/Pulse/logs/pulse-stdout.log | bun -e "process.stdin.on('data', d => { try { const e = JSON.parse(d); console.log(e.ts, e.level, e.msg) } catch {} })"
```

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "NOT RUNNING (no PID file)" | Pulse not started or crashed without recovery | `manage.sh install` |
| "DEAD (stale PID)" | Process died but launchd did not restart | `manage.sh restart` |
| Job stuck in circuit breaker | 3+ consecutive failures | Fix the check script, then `manage.sh restart` |
| "Telegram dispatch skipped" | Missing env vars | Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_PRINCIPAL_CHAT_ID` in `~/.claude/.env` |
| "ntfy dispatch skipped" | Missing env var | Set `NTFY_TOPIC` in `~/.claude/.env` |
| Voice notifications silent | Voice module not running or Pulse down | `manage.sh restart`; check `[voice] enabled = true` in PULSE.toml |
| Calendar returns NO_EVENTS always | Missing or expired refresh token | Set `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `~/.claude/.env` |
| State file corrupt | Interrupted write (unlikely, writes are atomic) | Delete `state/state.json` and restart |

### Manual Job Test

Run a check script directly to verify it works:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/Pulse
bun run checks/health.ts
bun run checks/calendar.ts
bun run checks/email.ts
bun run checks/github.ts
```

## Menu Bar App

LifeOS Pulse includes a native macOS menu bar app that shows daemon status at a glance. The menu bar app is launched automatically by Pulse on startup -- no separate launchd plist needed.

**Location:** `~/.claude/LIFEOS/PULSE/MenuBar/`
**Installed to:** `~/Applications/LifeOS Pulse.app`
**Launched by:** Pulse process on startup (no separate launchd plist)

### What It Shows

- Status icon: green (running), yellow (stale tick >2min), red (jobs failing), gray (stopped)
- Uptime
- Each job: name, schedule (human readable), last run time, status
- Start/Stop/Restart controls (calls `manage.sh`)
- Quick access to logs and PULSE.toml

### How It Determines Status

Reads `state/state.json` directly every 5 seconds (no HTTP endpoint needed). Checks:
- File modification time for freshness
- `pulse.pid` process existence
- `consecutiveFailures` counts for job health

### Building and Installing

```bash
cd ~/.claude/LIFEOS/PULSE/MenuBar
bash install.sh    # Builds, deploys to ~/Applications, installs plist
```

To rebuild after changes:
```bash
bash build.sh      # Compiles PulseMenuBar.swift → LifeOS Pulse.app
```

---

## Hook Validation Server

Pulse includes an integrated HTTP hook validation server as the `hooks` module (`modules/hooks.ts`). Hook routes are served on the same port 31337 as all other Pulse HTTP endpoints.

### Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/hooks/skill-guard` | POST | Blocks false-positive skill invocations (e.g., `keybindings-help` triggered by position bias) |
| `/hooks/agent-guard` | POST | Foreground agents: warns "consider run_in_background: true". Background agents: injects watchdog Monitor reminder (`Tools/AgentWatchdog.ts`) to detect hung agents via tool-activity.jsonl silence. |
| `/health` | GET | Returns unified status: Pulse jobs + module health + hook stats |

### Behavior

- **Fail-open:** If Pulse is unreachable, Claude Code treats hooks as non-blocking success. This is acceptable for skill-guard (minor annoyance) and agent-guard (warning only). These Pulse HTTP routes are the ONLY implementation — the standalone `.hook.ts` files (`SkillGuard.hook.ts`, `AgentExecutionGuard.hook.ts`) were deleted.
- **Security hooks stay as command hooks:** `SecurityPipeline.hook.ts` uses `process.exit(2)` for hard-blocking. HTTP hooks would fail-open on connection failure, which is unacceptable for security operations.
- **Port:** 31337 (shared with all Pulse modules), bound to 127.0.0.1 only.

### Hook Configuration

The hooks are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` as HTTP hooks pointing to `http://localhost:31337/hooks/*`.

---

## LifeOS Typography System

The official LifeOS font system uses Butterick fonts (practicaltyography.com). These fonts are used across all LifeOS UI surfaces — the Pulse Observatory dashboard, marketing sites, and blog.

### Font Roles

| Role | Font Family | CSS Name | Usage |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Body sans** | Concourse T3 | `concourse-t3` | All body text, paragraphs, UI labels |
| **Display headings** | Advocate C14 | `advocate-c14` | Section headers, nav labels, page titles |
| **Narrow headings** | Advocate N34 | `advocate-n34` | h2 headings, subheadings |
| **Tab/branding** | Advocate C41 | `advocate-c41` | Logo text, branding elements |
| **Caps labels** | Heliotrope Caps | `heliotrope-caps` | Uppercase section labels, h3 |
| **Serif text** | Heliotrope T3 | `heliotrope-t3` | Serif body text |
| **Serif accent** | Valkyrie Text | `valkyrie-text` | h1 headings, identity cards, prose |
| **Monospace** | Triplicate A Code | `triplicate-a-code` | Code blocks, data values, cron expressions |
| **Serif body** | Equity Text | `equity-text` | Blockquotes, editorial content |
| **Caps sans** | Concourse C3 | `concourse-c3` | Small caps, category labels |

### Heading Hierarchy (CSS)

```css
body     { font-family: 'concourse-t3', sans-serif; }
h1       { font-family: 'valkyrie-text', Georgia, serif; }
h2       { font-family: 'advocate-n34', sans-serif; }
h3       { font-family: 'heliotrope-caps', sans-serif; }
h4-h6    { font-family: 'advocate-c14', sans-serif; }
code     { font-family: 'triplicate-a-code', monospace; }
```

### Font Files

Font files live in `Pulse/Observability/public/fonts/` and are loaded via `@font-face` in `globals.css`. Source files are from the principal's licensed Butterick font collection (any user must supply their own licensed fonts here).

**Never use Google Fonts (Orbitron, Share Tech Mono) or system monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) in LifeOS UI.**

## Observability Module -- Observatory Dashboard & Security APIs

The observability module (`Observability/observability.ts`) serves the Observatory dashboard and exposes data + security management APIs on port 31337.

### Dashboard Serving

Pulse serves the Observatory dashboard from a symlink:

```
Pulse/dashboard/out  →  Observability/out
```

The `Observability/out` directory is produced by the Next.js static export (`bun run build` in `LIFEOS/Observability`). Pulse serves these files as static assets. All static files are served with aggressive no-cache headers:

```
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
```

This ensures the browser always picks up new builds without stale content.

### Deployment Procedure

After building the Observatory dashboard, Pulse must be restarted to pick up new files:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/LIFEOS/Observability && bun run build
launchctl stop com.lifeos.pulse && launchctl start com.lifeos.pulse
```

**Do NOT use `kill -9` to restart Pulse.** Because launchd has `KeepAlive = true`, a killed process respawns immediately with potentially stale code. The `launchctl stop/start` sequence ensures a clean shutdown, state persistence, and fresh module initialization.

### Data APIs

The observability module serves all dashboard data. Full API reference with all ~40 endpoints is in `LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/Observability/ObservabilitySystem.md` under "API Reference." Key categories:

| Category | Endpoints | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Core Observability | `/api/observability/*`, `/api/events/recent` | Session state, events, voice logs, tool failures |
| Algorithm & Sessions | `/api/algorithm`, `/api/algorithm/stream` (SSE), `/api/agents` | Work sessions, subagents, learning signals. `/api/novelty` + `/api/ladder` handlers retained UI-less — surfaces archived as future work 2026-07-08 (`MEMORY/WORK/20260708-hypotheses-novelty-ladder-integration/DESIGN.md`) |
| Life Dashboard | `/api/life/home`, `/api/life/health`, `/api/life/finances`, `/api/life/business`, `/api/life/work`, `/api/life/goals` | Narrative + domain data powering the `/life` biography dashboard |
| LifeOS Index | `/api/user-index[?filter=stats\|publish\|stale\|gaps]` | Typed JSON of USER/ tree produced by `modules/user-index.ts` — spec: `LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/LifeOs/LifeOsSchema.md` |
| Security | `/api/security`, `/api/security/patterns`, `/api/security/rules`, `/api/security/hooks-detail` | PATTERNS.yaml + SECURITY_RULES.md CRUD |
| Knowledge | `/api/knowledge`, `/api/knowledge/:domain/:slug` | Knowledge archive read/write |
| Wiki | `/api/wiki`, `/api/wiki/search`, `/api/wiki/graph` | System docs, full-text search, knowledge graph (wikilink-based; CLI `KnowledgeGraph.ts` provides richer graph with tags + related fields) |
| DA | `/assistant/*` | Identity, tasks, diary, opinions, personality |
| Voice | `/notify`, `/voice` | ElevenLabs TTS notifications |
| Hook Validation | `/hooks/skill-guard`, `/hooks/agent-guard` | PreToolUse HTTP hooks for Skill/Agent validation |
| Amber | `/api/amber` | Idea supply chain composite: ledger worker stats, KNOWLEDGE save counts, X-bookmark counts (KV + local), per-path sheet sends — served by `modules/amber.ts`, 60s cache |

### Adding a Dashboard Page (Tab) — the convention

Every Pulse page is two halves: a **data module** in the Bun server and a **static page** in the Next.js export. The pattern (2026-07-09, `/amber` is the reference implementation):

1. **Data module** — `PULSE/modules/<name>.ts` exporting `start()`, `handleRequest(req, pathname): Promise<Response|null>`, `health()`. The module owns ALL data access: file reads, worker fetches, cloud API calls. Secrets (bearer tokens, CF tokens) live only here — never in the page. Fail-soft per probe (independent try/catch, `errors` map in the payload), cache hot responses (~60s). SYSTEM-tree rule: no principal-identifying hostnames/IDs in the module — resolve instance values at runtime from USER-zone configs (`SystemFileGuard` enforces this at write time).
2. **Wire into `pulse.ts`** — module variable + `loadModules()` import/start + a route block `if (xModule && pathname.startsWith("/api/x"))` BEFORE the observability `/api/*` catch-all (mirror the books/amber blocks).
3. **Page** — `Observability/src/app/<name>/page.tsx`, a `"use client"` component that fetches `/api/<name>` and holds ZERO data. House style (unified design system, 2026-07-11): build the page from the chrome kit in `src/components/ui/chrome.tsx` — `<PageShell>` + `<PageHeader>` (serif title + subtitle), `Panel`/`PanelHeader` for cards, `StatTile` for numbers, `TabBar`/`Pill` for switchers and chips. Colors come ONLY from the global tokens in `globals.css` (`--ground/--surface-1..3/--line-1..3/--ink-1..3/--accent-blue/--ok/--warn/--err` + the six dimension vars; Tailwind utilities `bg-surface-2`, `border-line-2`, `text-ink-2`, `text-dim-health`, …). No page defines its own palette; no slate/zinc/hex chrome. Token opacity modifiers (`bg-surface-2/50`) don't work — use solid classes or rgba().
4. **Nav** — add to `src/lib/palette/nav-manifest.ts` (single source of truth for AppHeader AND the ⌘K palette): `tier1Nav` for Life sections, `systemNav` for machine pages (contextual second row, shows only inside System), `metaNav` for always-pinned meta tabs (currently AGENTS, pinned in the header's right cluster on every page; SYSTEM pinned tab lands on `systemHome` = `/assistant`). Rows `flex-wrap` — items roll to additional lines when they overflow; never clip behind hidden scroll.
5. **Freshness** — register the tab's data sources in `modules/tab-freshness.ts` REGISTRY so the freshness pill resolves.
6. **Deploy** — `bun run build` in Observability, then restart Pulse (Deployment Procedure above) to load the new module.

Note: static catalogs baked into a page or module (e.g. Amber's 11-input list mirroring `AmberSystem.md` §Inputs) are manually synced — when the source doc gains an entry, the page needs the matching edit.

### Realtime Phase Tracking (2026-05-24; push trigger 2026-06-10)

`/api/algorithm/stream` is the SSE channel that drives instant phase updates in the Agents → Iterate tab.

- **Mechanism (2026-06-10):** push-first — `fs.watch` on the STATE *directory* (filename-filtered to `work.json` / `work-events.jsonl`; dir-level because rename-replacement orphans file watchers) triggers the broadcast the moment a registry write lands. The original shared 100ms mtime poll is retained as a fallback for FSEvents coalescing/drops. On trigger → broadcast `event: algorithm` + `data: <full /api/algorithm payload>` to every connected `EventSource`. Initial snapshot delivered synchronously on connect. Payload shape unchanged from the 2026-05-24 design.
- **State source (2026-06-10):** `work.json` is now a DERIVED snapshot folded from the append-only event log `MEMORY/STATE/work-events.jsonl` (see `hooks/lib/work-events.ts`); writers append field-level diff events through `isa-utils.writeRegistry` and fold under a lock. Hand-edits to work.json are erased by the next fold.
- **Subscriber model:** independent try/catch per writer; slow consumers don't block the rest. Disconnect removes the subscriber and stops the poller when zero remain.
- **Keepalive:** `: keepalive\n\n` comment every 25s per subscriber so corporate proxies / macOS loopback don't drop idle connections.
- **Disable:** `LIFEOS_NO_SSE=1` env var → 503 on the endpoint, dashboard falls back to legacy 2s polling identically to pre-change behavior.
- **Dashboard contract:** `useAlgorithmState` hook tries SSE on mount; on three consecutive `onerror` events drops the EventSource and reverts polling to 2s. While SSE is connected, polling drops to 30s (safety net).
- **Atomic emitter:** `bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/AlgoPhase.ts <phase>` writes the current session's phase into `work.json` in ~22ms (p95 27ms). The Algorithm doctrine prescribes invocation at every phase transition. (Until 2026-07-11 a `TheRouter.hook.ts` pre-emit via `markAlgorithmStarting` closed the wrong-phase window at session start; that hook was deleted with the mode/tier retirement, so the first `AlgoPhase.ts`/`ISASync` write now sets the phase.)

## DA Module -- Digital Assistant Subsystem

The DA module formalizes how Pulse instantiates, manages, and evolves a Digital Assistant. It replaces manual DA_IDENTITY.md editing with a structured schema, adds proactive heartbeat evaluation, natural-language scheduled tasks, and identity growth over time.

### Architecture

The DA module adds four capabilities to Pulse:

1. **Identity Registry** -- Structured YAML identity per DA with personality traits, voice config, writing style, autonomy rules
2. **Heartbeat** -- Proactive "should I do something?" evaluation every 30 minutes (2-layer: free context + cheap Haiku eval, ~$0.05/day)
3. **Scheduled Tasks** -- JSONL-based task store with natural language creation, persistent across restarts
4. **Growth Engine** -- Daily diary, weekly opinion formation, bounded identity evolution

### Configuration

```toml
[da]
enabled = true
primary = "your-da"
heartbeat_schedule = "*/30 * * * *"
heartbeat_model = "haiku"
heartbeat_cost_ceiling = 0.01
diary_schedule = "0 23 * * *"
growth_schedule = "0 4 * * 0"
```

### File Structure

```
LIFEOS/USER/DA/
  _registry.yaml                # Which DAs exist, which is primary
  _presets.yaml                 # Personality presets for interview
  your-da/
    DA_IDENTITY.md              # Single identity file: YAML frontmatter (schema) + markdown body (prose)
    growth.jsonl                # Append-only growth events
    opinions.yaml               # Confidence-weighted beliefs
    diary.jsonl                 # Daily interaction summaries
  worker-da/
    DA_IDENTITY.md
    growth.jsonl
    opinions.yaml
    diary.jsonl
```

### Identity Schema

The DA_IDENTITY.md frontmatter schema covers: core identity (name, role, color), voice config, 12 personality traits (0-100), writing style, relationship context, autonomy rules (can_initiate vs must_ask), companion, and growth anchors. The markdown body below the frontmatter holds the human-readable narrative — personality, writing style, relationship dynamics, backstory.

### Heartbeat

Two-layer architecture:
- **Layer 1 ($0):** Deterministic context gathering -- calendar, email, active work, pending tasks, recent ratings
- **Layer 2 (~$0.001):** Single Haiku evaluation -- should I notify, remind, create a task, or stay silent?

Most evaluations return NO_ACTION. Cost: ~$0.05/day ($1.50/month).

### Scheduled Tasks

Tasks are stored in `Pulse/Assistant/state/scheduled-tasks.jsonl`. Types:
- **once** -- fires at a specific time, then completes
- **recurring** -- fires on cron schedule until cancelled or expired

Actions: notify (voice/telegram), prompt (LLM call), script (shell command).

Natural language routing:
- "remind me at 9am" --> Pulse local task (free)
- "every Monday research security news" --> CC trigger (cloud)

### Growth System

Three mechanisms:
1. **Diary** (daily 11PM) -- Summarizes sessions, topics, mood, notable moments
2. **Opinions** (weekly Sunday 4AM) -- Forms confidence-weighted beliefs about the principal
3. **Identity drift** (monthly) -- Personality traits evolve within bounded ranges (max 5 points/month)

### DA Interview

New LifeOS installations create DA identity via guided CLI interview:
```bash
bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts                    # Quick (under 2 min)
bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts --depth standard   # + personality refinement
bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts --depth deep       # + companion, beliefs
```

### Multi-DA Support

Registry tracks primary + worker DAs. Primary owns interactive channels (terminal, telegram, voice). Workers run background tasks only. Each DA has independent identity, growth, and opinions.

### HTTP API

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/assistant/health` | GET | Assistant subsystem health |
| `/assistant/identity` | GET | Current identity summary |
| `/assistant/tasks` | GET | Unified task view (DA + Pulse cron + CC triggers) |
| `/assistant/tasks` | POST | Create DA scheduled task |
| `/assistant/tasks/:id` | DELETE | Cancel DA task |
| `/assistant/diary` | GET | Recent diary entries |
| `/assistant/opinions` | GET | Current opinions |

### Tools

| Tool | Usage | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `DAInterview.ts` | `bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/DAInterview.ts` | Create/update DA identity |
| `DASchedule.ts` | `bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/DASchedule.ts list` | Manage scheduled tasks |
| `DAGrowth.ts` | `bun LIFEOS/TOOLS/DAGrowth.ts summary` | View growth data |

### Competitive Context

This subsystem provides all features of OpenClaw's SOUL.md identity system plus: structured schema (vs flat markdown), guided interview (vs manual editing), proactive heartbeat (matched), scheduled tasks (matched), opinion formation (novel), bounded identity growth (novel), and multi-DA support (novel). At 30-50x lower cost than OpenClaw's GPT-4 heartbeat.
