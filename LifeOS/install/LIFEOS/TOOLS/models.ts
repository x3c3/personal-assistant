/**
 * ============================================================================
 * MODELS — single source of truth for model IDs across LifeOS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * Model IDs used to be pinned in scattered files. On a new model release the
 * updates were a manual scramble and drifted silently (e.g. ContextAudit
 * checked for claude-opus-4-7 long after claude-opus-4-8 shipped). This file
 * is the one place that knows current IDs. Consumers either:
 *   (a) use a tier ALIAS ("opus"/"sonnet"/"haiku") — auto-resolves to latest,
 *       no registry needed (preferred — see Pulse manifests, Inference.ts), or
 *   (b) import CURRENT[...] from here when they genuinely need a pinned ID
 *       (e.g. a drift-check that must name the expected latest).
 *
 * ON A NEW RELEASE: bump CURRENT below (one edit), then `bun UpdateModels.ts
 * --check` confirms nothing else drifted. The _NEWS Anthropic monitor surfaces
 * a proposal when it detects a new model; application is propose-not-auto.
 *
 * NOT IN SCOPE: cross-vendor pins (Forge gpt-5.6-sol, build+audit modes) track their own
 * vendors — recorded here for inventory, never auto-bumped to Claude.
 * ============================================================================

/**
 * ============================================================================
 * EFFORT LEVELS — the four-level abstraction over the Claude lineup
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Consumers name INTENT (max/high/medium/low), never a model name. Two
 * independent edit points keep the system cohesive across model churn:
 *
 *   Layer 1  EFFORT_MODEL  level → tier   edit when the LINEUP changes
 *                                          (a model enters/exits the
 *                                          subscription, or moves rungs)
 *   Layer 2  CURRENT       tier → ID      edit when a VERSION releases
 *
 * NO ROUTING POLICY LIVES HERE (baseline, 2026-07-11, principal directive):
 * which level a given piece of work gets is {{DA_NAME}}'s per-dispatch judgment —
 * no hook injection, no classifier, no tier rubric. This table is the dial
 * behind `Inference.ts --level` and the display labels (statusline,
 * AgentInvocation logging). `medium`/`low` exist so cheap utility calls
 * (classification, summarization, vision triage) have named rungs.

/**
 * Level → tier binding. THIS IS THE SINGLE EDIT POINT on a lineup change.
 * Example: Fable exits the subscription → `max: "opus"` and every consumer
 * follows; no other code changes. Fable is the top rung (~2× Opus cost), so
 * `max` and `high` are distinct models and the Inference.ts max-fallback
 * (fable→opus) is a genuinely real degraded path.
 *
 * BASELINE (2026-07-11, principal directive — supersedes every prior routing
 * decision in this file's history; see ALGORITHM/changelog.md): model
 * selection is {{DA_NAME}}'s per-dispatch judgment. The saved `/model` default is
 * Fable 5 [1m] (settings.json). No hook injects models (AgentInvocation
 * v1.3.0 observes only), no classifier routes tiers, no rubric maps work to
 * rungs. Unspecified delegate models inherit the session model (harness
 * behavior).
 *
 * CARRIER REALITY — tool-contract facts, not steering. THIS COMMENT IS THE
 * CANONICAL HOME of these facts — prose elsewhere (OPERATIONAL_RULES,
 * Algorithm §Spend) carries one line + a pointer here, never a restatement.
 * Freshness: `CarrierProbe.ts` re-probes end-to-end (dispatch → subagent
 * transcript model read-back) and records to MEMORY/STATE/carrier-probe.json;
 * /ic fails when the probe is stale (>30d) or contradicts DISPATCH_EXECUTES_FABLE.
 *
 * PROBED 2026-07-12 (CarrierProbe.ts first run + manual inheritance leg;
 * evidence = subagent transcript assistant-message model, no fallback blocks).
 * This FLIPPED the 2026-07-07/-11 facts — a harness update fixed dispatch:
 *   - Agent dispatches now execute their model FAITHFULLY: explicit
 *     `model: fable` executed claude-fable-5, and bare inheritance from a
 *     Fable main loop executed claude-fable-5. The old downgrade-to-Opus
 *     behavior is GONE. (History: 07-07/-11 probes showed both paths running
 *     claude-opus-4-8 with a `fallback` block; see git history of this file.)
 *   - Genuine Fable carriers are therefore: the main loop, `Inference.ts
 *     --level max`, AND Agent dispatch. A subagent's self-report is still
 *     NOT evidence — the transcript is.
 *   - VERIFICATION (integrity linchpin): Inference.ts reads the executed
 *     model back from the JSON envelope's modelUsage (verifyExecutedModel —
 *     filters the background haiku pass, takes the highest-output model as
 *     the answer's author, checks its family) and logs any downgrade to
 *     model-verification.jsonl. The system reports what RAN, never what it
 *     requested.
